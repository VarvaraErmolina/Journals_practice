In particular, the contrastive analysis explores the common linguistic representation of meanings through body part metaphorical expressions in Italian, French, Spanish and English. While several efforts to gauge the existence of a “European linguistic type” (cf. Haspelmath, 2001) have been largely devoted to the study of grammatical structures, a systematic account of the lexical component of the major European languages has not been attempted yet. Among the lexical units, phraseological expressions (e.g. compounds, multiword units, idiomatic expressions, as well as light verb and light noun constructions) represent a relevant ground to inquire into, since they are the most transparent and authentic vehicle of common ideas and experiences gradually rooted in European communicative realities.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.21013.vin;Igor Vinogradov;Pioneers of contrastive linguistics: Dominican missionaries in Highland Guatemala;2022;This paper revisits the translational practices of Dominican missionaries who worked in multilingual settings in the Guatemalan highlands in the colonial period. It is argued that the missionaries developed the emerging ideas of European Renaissance linguistics and applied methods of contrastive linguistics to indigenous languages long before this discipline came into being. The main argument derives from an 18th-century collection of missionary writings in Q’eqchi’ and Poqomchi’, two Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala. An uncommon phrase-by-phrase alignment of bilingual texts allows for the assumption that a contrastive approach to genetically related languages could be the underlying principle in language learning and translation at that time.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.21004.sie;Dirk Siepmann;This deserves a brief mention: A multi-corpus comparison of written and spoken academic discourse in English and French with implications for pedagogy and: lexicography;2022;"This article takes a doubly contrastive approach to spoken academic language. On the one hand, it explores genre differences between spoken and written academic English and French; on the other, it considers divergences between spoken academic discourse in the two languages. The corpora used for this purpose were purpose-built on the basis of YouTube video subtitles and other sources. The focus of attention is on keywords and key metadiscursive routines. The results suggest that, somewhat counterintuitively, the distance between academic speech and writing is smaller in French than it is in English, so that written routines can be more easily transferred to speech in French. French written and spoken discourse shows a greater degree of abstraction and self-referentiality than is the case in English. The article selectively illustrates that both French and English have a distinct set of spoken routines that are not used in writing; these need to be described and recorded in lexicographic resources to make them available for teachers and learners.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.22004.cac;"Caterina Cacioli; Paola Vernillo";How did you break that?: Semantic boundaries of Italian and English  action verbs encoding breaking events;2023;Cross-linguistic research has brought extensive evidence on how languages differ in their categorization of actions and events, pointing out the differences in the semantic categories they establish, their boundaries and their degree of granularity with respect to the variety of events they refer to. Verbs describing breaking events vary in terms of generality or specificity of the action description (e.g., breaking or snapping a twig) or salience of specific semantic components characterising the event (e.g., smash being associated with violent destruction) and the same event can be construed differently within the same language (e.g., crack/break an egg). In this article we set out to explore the semantic boundaries of verbs describing breaking events within and between languages. We propose a new methodology combining corpora and a video ontology, using verb pairs generally regarded as translation equivalents in bilingual dictionaries. The study contributes to research on semantic categorization and verbs correspondences between Italian and English.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.17.1.01bou;Myriam Boulin;Now and xianzai: A contrastive study of two deictic adverbs;2017;"The present study looks at the deictic adverbs now and ?? (xianzai) and examines their respective roles in English and Chinese. Now and xianzai are commonly considered to be semantically equivalent. Their primary value is temporal: both now and xianzai refer to the time of utterance, or more generally to a temporal interval which includes the time of utterance. By examining a parallel corpus of Taiwanese and English novels, this paper aims to show that apart from this present-reference value, now and xianzai have little in common. The analysis of aligned texts reveals that: (1) now is more frequent than xianzai; (2) there is an asymmetry in the temporal use of both markers. Following Wang (2001), I argue that now has a wider semantic range than xianzai: whereas now might be used pragmatically (Now, why on earth did she leave at such a time?), xianzai is limited to strict temporal reference. It appears that even in its temporal use, now is more complex than xianzai; now is quasi-systematically contrastive, whereas xianzai tends to be purely deictic. We conclude that now is closer in function to the Chinese particle le than to the adverb xianzai.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

These constructions are compared to their functional equivalents in Italian, i.e. reporting clauses with che (‘that’) complementiser. The comparison is carried out using a corpus-based approach, involving the analysis of a parallel corpus of Political Science papers in English and their translations into Italian, as well as a comparable corpus of articles originally written in Italian within the same discipline. Thanks to their ability to convey evaluative meanings, reporting clauses are analysed as structures that may provide insights into the epistemological negotiations taking place in the encounter of different research traditions through the practice of translation.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.17.1.03ber;Thomas Berg;Compounding in German and English: A quantitative translation study;2017;"German is well-known for its propensity for nominal compounding. This claim is put on a firmer empirical footing by means of a bidirectional translation study between German and English. The difference between the two languages crystallizes in the competition between compounds and phrases. Two complementary asymmetries emerge: first, German compounds are more frequently translated by English phrases than English compounds by German phrases; second, English phrases are more frequently translated by German compounds than German phrases by English compounds. An extension to other word classes shows that the compounding bias in German is not restricted to nouns. It is tentatively argued that the token frequency of word classes plays a role in the emergence of compound propensity. The heavier use of nouns and adjectives in German than in English might be partly responsible for the higher rate of nominal and adjectival compounding in the former than the latter language.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Starting from the hypothesis that markers of (dis)fluency, or ‘fluencemes’, occur more frequently in sequences than in isolation, and that their contribution to the relative fluency of discourse can only be assessed by taking into account the contextual distribution of these sequences, this study uncovers the specific contextual conditions that trigger the clustering of fluencemes in the two languages. First, the contexts of appearance of DMs and FPs are described separately, both in English and French, focusing on their distribution, position and co-occurrence patterns. Then, the combination of DMs and FPs in sequences and their different configurations (DM+FP, FP+DM, etc.) are investigated. Overall, it appears that FPs function differently depending on whether they are clustered with DMs or not, and this difference consists in either maintaining or erasing inter- and intra-linguistic contrasts.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Thus, we will show that singular deictics are used more widely in Spanish parliamentary discourse, whereas plural forms are preferred in Catalan, which is possibly related to more general cultural features and to the political system as a whole. Furthermore, we will discuss differences in the use of the formal address forms. Finally, we will show that some differences in the use of vocatives may be due to the debating styles and history of the respective parliaments.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Participants completed an online discourse completion test with nine different complimenting scenarios. A total of 14 different strategies for responding to a compliment were found in the data. Based on verbal reports on language use, it was found that Peninsular Spanish speakers do not compliment as often as American English speakers do. The data analysis also revealed that both language groups clearly prefer to accept a compliment, but whereas American English speakers regard a simple ‘thank you’ as an appropriate compliment response, Peninsular Spanish speakers prefer to agree with the complimented assertion by making a semantically fitted comment. Other differences include the importance of returning a compliment in American English and the need to scale down the illocutionary force of the compliment among Peninsular Spanish speakers.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

As an introduction to this first volume of Languages in Contrast devoted to the comparison of spoken and signed languages, we propose to look at the reasons for the late emergence of the consideration of signed languages and multimodality in language studies. Next, the main stages of the history of sign language research are summarized.

This contextualization prefaces the presentation of the outline of the volume.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.00023.qui;"David Quinto-Pozos; Fey Parrill; Caitie Coons";The interface between grammar and bodily enactment in ASL and English;2022;Users of signed and spoken languages regularly engage bodily enactment (commonly referred to as constructed action [CA] for signers and character viewpoint gestures [CVPT] for speakers) for the creation of meaning, but comparatively few studies have addressed how linguistic grammar interfaces with such gestural depictive devices across language modalities. CVPT gestures have been shown to co-occur with spoken language transitive verbs, and when a reference is definite or more accessible in the discourse. In sign, CA often alternates sequentially with fully conventionalized signs. In both CVPT and CA demonstrations, syntactic and pragmatic factors appear to be important. In this work, we consider these patterns by examining short retellings of video-based elicitation stimuli (silent-movie segments) from 10 deaf users of ASL (American Sign Language) and 20 hearing speakers of English. We describe examples of signs and words that co-occur with or precede specific instances of CA and CVPT. We also examine distributions and degrees of enactment across participants in order to consider the question of gesture threshold (Hostetter and Alibali, 2008, 2019). We provide various examples of how gestural material interfaces with linguistic grammar, which has implications for syntactic theory and possible grammatical constraints on such communicative devices.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.00020.jan;Terry Janzen;Embodied cognition: ASL signers’ and English speakers’ use of viewpointed space;2022;Recent work has shown that ASL (American Sign Language) signers not only articulate the language in the space in front of and around them, they interact with that space bodily, such that those interactions are frequently viewpointed. At a basic level, signers use their bodies to depict the actions of characters, either themselves or others, in narrative retelling. These viewpointed instances seem to reflect “embodied cognition”, in that our construal of reality is largely due to the nature of our bodies (Evans and Green, 2006) and “embodied language” such that the symbols we use to communicate are “grounded in recurring patterns of bodily experience” (Gibbs, 2017:?450). But what about speakers of a spoken language such as English? While we know that meaning and structure for any language, whether spoken or signed, affect and are affected by the embodied mind (note that the bulk of research on embodied language has been about spoken, not signed, language), we can learn much about embodied cognition and viewpointed space when spoken languages are treated as multimodal. Here, we compare signed ASL and spoken, multimodal English discourse to examine whether the two languages incorporate viewpointed space in similar or different ways.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Among the forms we examine are grammatical, corporal and rhythm markers. As for the types of character perspective shift examined, we focus on the nature of the event that is being enacted: speech, thought, action or gesture. The dataset employed in the study consists of short, elicited narratives using video sketches as stimuli. Both Deaf signers and French speakers were asked to describe short scenarios that were displayed without any signing or speech. Half of the stimuli were constructed from a series of factual events containing no emphatic reactions or actions, while the other half included emphatic elements. Twenty-four narratives produced by these two groups were transcribed and coded using ELAN to determine the distribution of character perspective shift sequences (CPS) used in terms of presence (duration) and frequency (occurrences). Further markers were also identified in terms of frequency, which was then analyzed with a factorial ANOVA statistical model. The overall finding of this study is that CPS is used in both language groups, despite their varying results in terms of the distribution of frequency and markers.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Typically, the temporal structure of gesture and sign can be decomposed into a stream of distinct manual phases. There are moments, however, when this activity is stopped. This may happen for various reasons, e.g., when seeking attention, holding the floor or during overlaps. Holds have mostly been examined in sign languages regarding prosody, syntax, and corresponding to vowel lengthening in spoken languages. In gesture studies, they have been overlooked for not deemed relevant in the gesture-speech interface. By combining contrastive and multimodal analyses, this paper examines the relevance of holds as potential meaning-making practices deployed by LSFB signers and its comparison to Belgian French speakers. In 3 hours of video-recorded material drawn from 3 multimodal corpora, the following question is addressed: what are the roles of holds in the management of interaction within and across languages/modalities? While most of linguistic work considers manual movements to express referential content, the observations here push to reconsider the common boundary set between what constitutes gestural/linguistic phenomena in one language and what does not.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Because of its metalinguistic nature, combined with its general aim of clarifying an expression, the act of reformulation offers a window to the way speakers process and adjust their expression in discourse. However, to date, the study of reformulation has hardly taken into account the now increasingly recognized multimodal and semiotically composite nature of language. This study aims to revisit the notion of reformulation from a multimodal perspective by comparing the use and semiotic composition of reformulations in the discourse of speakers and signers, as well as in the productions of interpreters. In doing so, we lay the foundations for a comparative study of discourse in signed and spoken language that accounts for the multimodality and semiotic complexity of language practices in different human ecologies.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Levels of identifiability and number, each of which has been suggested in a separate semantic map as necessary for capturing impersonalization, are also shown to interact, supporting a proposal to combine them in one map.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

We examined the strategies of ‘enjoying the experience’ and ‘aesthetic appeal’ from an Appraisal Theory approach (Martin and White, 2005). We categorised these according to the attitude sub-systems of ‘affect’, ‘appreciation’, and ‘judgement’, determined how explicit the evaluation was, and identified gradable resources. Results show that English texts display more ‘affect’-like resources that can awaken a desire in the customer. By contrast, in the Spanish sample ‘appreciation’ resources that evaluate the composition of the product play a greater role. ‘Enjoying the experience’ seems to engage with the customers’ emotions more overtly than ‘aesthetic appeal’.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

More specifically, it deals with the question of whether the word-formation pattern of proper name compounding in German and Dutch is an instance of grammatical borrowing from English, as is often claimed in the literature. To this end, we conduct a structural analysis of the pattern in the three languages based on original and translation corpus data. We show that the pattern which, at first glance, seems to be identical in all three languages has in fact different properties in each language. Although this does not necessarily preclude transfer from English, we conclude that there is no evidence in favour of such an influence.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

His Gallic? lingu? institutio (1550/1561), although written in Latin, contains numerous passages where Pillot subtly confronted French with Greek, surveyed in Section 2, in order to give his audience of educated German speakers a clearer view of the idiosyncrasies of French. In Section 3, I analyze why he preferred Greek to the other languages he knew in quite a number of cases, arguing that this subtle contrastive endeavor bore an indirect pedagogical and ideological load. Section 4 discusses the terminological means Pillot used to confront Greek with French, and their origins. In Section 5, I frame Pillot’s appropriation of Greek grammar in the long history of contrastive language studies, with special reference to the pivotal role of sixteenth-century linguistic analysis.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Studies show that event descriptions differ cross-linguistically due to, amongst other factors, the absence or presence of grammatical aspect. While speakers of aspect languages generally focus on the process, speakers of non-aspect languages tend to perceive the event holistically and focus on endpoints. This investigation examines visual endpoint salience as a further factor that shapes event encoding. Thus, in this model, grammatical aspect is seen as a part of a more complex system of factors that determine event construal. The analyses, which cover German speakers, English speakers, and German-speaking learners of English, involve linguistic production data and results from memory performance tests. The findings show that the focus on endpoints increases for salient stimuli. While German speakers and learners of English show a tendency to focus on endpoints, a clear preference for focusing on the process can be observed in English speakers. Verbalizing endpoints correlates with the ability to remember them in a memorization task. The implications of these outcomes are discussed in the context of two factors which shape event encoding: grammatical aspect and endpoint salience.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

This contrastive study compares the realisations of the pragmatic function of hedging in everyday Norwegian and English conversations using data from four corpora of Norwegian and English informal spoken conversations (the Norwegian Speech Corpus, the Nordic Dialect Corpus, the BigBrother corpus, and the BNC2014). The results show that speakers of both languages mainly use pragmatic particles, adverbs, and first-/second-person pronouns + cognitive verbs [1/2 pers. + Cog. V] to express hedging. Furthermore, English speakers use significantly more [1/2 pers. + Cog.

We thus utilise a variation-oriented aggregative analysis technique to address these questions: (a) What is the precise extent to which Eurolects are similar to each other?

Our methodology starts out from a meticulously catalogued list of corpus-based and corpus-driven lexical and grammatical features. Through the observed presence or absence of these features, we calculate in a second step the aggregate linguistic distances between all of the Eurolects.

Although the extraction of n?grams from a corpus may seem straightforward, it proves to be very challenging when applied cross-linguistically (cf. e.g. Ebeling and Ebeling, 2013; Granger and Lefer, 2013; ?erm?kov? and Chlumsk?, 2017). The major issue is that the quantities of n?grams of a certain length in typologically different languages do not correspond. Consequently, n?grams of a given length may function differently across languages, rendering a direct comparison inadequate. Our paper introduces a function capable of modelling the relation between the quantities of n?grams in typologically distant languages, using the example of Czech and English (and some other language pairs). Based on our model, we can suggest what n?gram lengths should be contrasted to better reflect the size of n?gram inventories in each language. The correspondence may not be intuitive (e.g. a Czech 2-gram may best correspond to an English 2.5-gram), but it still provides researchers with a general guide as to what might be useful to include in their analysis (e.g. in this case 2-grams in Czech and 2- and 3-grams in English).";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Findings suggest that both languages show negative and restricted syntactic templates. Variables are coinages that originate from the processes of conversion in English (e.g. don’t you John me) and gender polarity in Spanish (e.g. ni luna ni *luno). Hence, although both types of variables are morphologically novel and contextually meaningful, Spanish variables are generally ungrammatical and unlikely to exist outside the discursive frame under study.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

A syntactic mismatch is the non-similarity between the syntactic structures of one linguistic unit and its translation. Syntactic mismatches are formalized using the notion of paraphrase from the Meaning-Text Theory, which allows for capturing mismatches at different levels of the linguistic description (e.g. Semantic, Deep-Syntactic, and Surface-Syntactic). In this paper, we report in details on the types of paraphrases found in the seed corpus used, demonstrating that the Deep-Syntactic paraphrases constitute the best starting point for our study.

Notable about Old Spanish is that, prior to the 1500s, interpolation arrangements were acceptable and rather common, as is still the case of Galician and some dialects of Portuguese. However, from the 1500s onward, interpolation in Old Spanish was no longer productive, much like modern Asturian. This is evidence that the “strong-weak” dichotomy of FP is insufficient to explain the situation of the languages. I argue that the strength of FP should be described as not only “weak” or “strong,” but instead on a gradient scale to distinguish languages that permit a range of possible clitic arrangements.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The analysis examines the frequency and types of connectives that can express an additive relation, in order to contrast its “markedness” in the two languages, that is, whether addition is marked by dedicated connectives or by ambiguous, polyfunctional ones. Furthermore, we investigate the functions of the most frequent additive connective in each language (namely et and the sign SAME), starting from the observation that most connectives are highly polyfunctional. This analysis intends to show which functions are compatible with the meaning of addition in spoken and signed discourse. Despite a common core of shared discourse functions, the equivalence between et and SAME is only partial and relates to a difference in their semantics.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.19006.cap;"Bert Cappelle; Vassil Mostrov; Fayssal Tayalati";Temperaments, tempers, and temporality: Constructions reveal how speakers of French  and English conceptualize human properties;2020;This study focuses on French and English abstract nouns denoting properties that can be ascribed to humans, such as beauty, carefulness and anger. Previous research showed that some but not all of these nouns are licensed in both locative existentials (e.g., There’s an intense anger in Isabella) and possessive existentials (e.g., Isabella has an intense anger). What remains unclear is how these and other patterns correlate among themselves depending on how easily they host such nouns. We here use speaker ratings of these nouns in different constructional environments. A principal component analysis suggests that the main dimension underlying native speakers’ ratings of these abstract nouns in six different patterns is temporal limitability. This gradable distinction, strongly correlated with the locative existential, holds for both the French and English data and outweighs any French-English contrastive differences in how acceptable human property nouns are considered to be in the patterns studied.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

It is shown that both patterns are almost equally productive at the subject complement level. Furthermore, a more in-depth analysis demonstrates that, in the segment of participles with a high adjectival potential, devenir accumulates more participle tokens than become. Conversely, the reverse holds true for participles with a high verbal potential, in which case become is characterized by more participle tokens than devenir. This high amount of combinations between become and eventive participles also suggests a higher degree of passivity for become. However, in the segment of participles with an intermediate verbal potential, devenir is slightly more type frequent than become, which hints at an emerging productivity in this area for devenir as well.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The first aim is to quantify the use of the patterns of denominal verb formations in both languages. The results of the analysis corroborate the findings of previous analyses, such as the strong preference for conversion for denominal verb formation in English and for suffixation in Modern Greek. However, the present paper aims to go a step further. The second aim is to discuss why English and Modern Greek show these preferences. I propose that the preferences can be explained if we correlate the parameters of inflectional marking, word order/configurationality, system of lexical category assignment and boundary permeability.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

10.1075/lic.00016.nad;Olga N?dvorn?kov?;Differences in the lexical variation  of reporting verbs in French,  English and Czech fiction  and their impact on: translation;2020;The aims of this paper are to analyse differences in the degree of lexical variation (type/token ratio and hapax/token ratio) of reporting verbs in reporting clauses placed medially or in postposition in English, French and Czech fiction and to evaluate their consequences in translation, especially in regard to explicitation/implicitation. We expect that, in translations from a language with a low degree of lexical variation of reporting verbs into a language with a high degree of lexical variation, the frequency and the degree of explicitation will be higher than in translations involving languages less different with respect to lexical variation. The analysis, relying on data extracted from the InterCorp multilingual corpus, proposes a classification of reporting verbs based on the type and amount of information conveyed, which allows evaluating the degree of explicitation operated in translations. The results show that most shifts involve only the neutral reporting verb say/dire, replaced by a stylistically more specific synonym or by a verb explicitating information obvious from the context. This suggests that modifications of reporting verbs in translation are motivated primarily by respect for the stylistic norm of the target language and the degree of acceptability of the repetition of the neutral reporting verb.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

In particular, the study examines questions containing a question mark (QMquestions) categorised into wh-interrogatives, polar interrogatives, alternative questions, tag questions (including those with invariant tags), declarative questions, wh-fragments and non-wh-fragments. The parallel analysis shows that most QMquestion types are more often translated congruently into English than into Swedish. The focus is on types with low mutual correspondence scores: fragments, tag questions and declarative questions. The comparable analyses concern both bilingual contrasts between the original texts and monolingual contrasts between the translation and original subcorpora in both languages. The bilingual analysis aligns with several preliminary findings in the parallel analysis, e.g. the favouring of tag questions and some types of wh-fragments in English. The monolingual analysis reveals both over- and underuse in translations and points to a strong effect of source-language influence.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.00018.dup;Ma?t? Dupont;Placement patterns of English and French conjunctive adjuncts of contrast: The impact of register;2020;In many languages, conjunctive adjuncts (e.g. however, therefore) are syntactically mobile. Several corpus-based contrastive studies have shown that languages differ in the positions that they tend to prefer for conjunctive adjuncts. However, the studies available have formulated general cross-linguistic differences in placement for languages as wholes, without considering the possibility that such contrasts may be influenced by register. The objective of this paper is to investigate and compare the placement patterns of English and French conjunctive adjuncts of contrast in two written registers (viz. editorials and research articles) in order to measure the impact of register variation on the differences between these two languages. The results suggest that, although register variation plays a significant role on placement within each language system, language is a better predictor of placement than register, since cross-linguistic differences in placement between English and French are stable across communicative situations. In a second stage, the results obtained in the comparable corpus study are complemented with the analysis of translation data, with a view to assessing the translators’ degree of awareness of the inherent word order preferences of the target language. The study is grounded in the framework of Systemic Functional Linguistics and relies on the notions of Theme and Rheme to describe conjunctive adjunct placement.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Rather than studying fiction as a unified register, we investigate to what extent fiction can be seen to contain (at least) two distinct registers – dialogue and narrative – and to what extent this may have implications for contrastive studies based on a corpus such as the ENPC. Token counts show that, although the texts are predominantly narrative in nature, the Norwegian texts are even more so than the English ones. On the basis of word lists, two items proportionally more frequent in dialogue and that had previously been studied on the basis of the fiction texts in the ENPC were identified and chosen for further scrutiny: there and see. Results from these two case studies uncover some differences in the use of there and see in dialogue vs. narrative, most conspicuously for see where its preferred use in dialogue is the cognition sense and in narrative the perception sense. For there, a noticeable difference is the choice of verb in the Norwegian translations of existential there-clauses in dialogue and narrative. In narrative, verbs other than verbs of existence are sometimes chosen, while this is never the case in dialogue.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

While in English -ist is often used to designate a person who devotes himself to some science or branch of knowledge (linguist), or refers to an adherent of some creed, doctrine, or art (idealist), Italian -ista has extended its use to new meanings (e.g. supporter of a politician, an artist, etc.), and possible bases, from roots to phrases. Moreover, -ista has also extended its applicability to recent loan words and abbreviations, thus becoming more frequent than -ist and often corresponding to the -er suffix (e.g. shampooer vs. shampista) or nominal compounds (e.g. taxi driver vs. tassista) in the formation of agent nouns. The present contrastive (corpus-based and dictionary-based) analyses confirm that -ista is more productive than -ist in terms of possible bases and varied meanings, which have entered the Italian lexicon and are available for the formation of neologisms.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The purpose of the present study is to identify translation correspondences of the English spatial demonstrative this in Lithuanian and to discuss the contrastive features within the analytical framework of translational explicitation and implicitation. The results indicate that in the prototypical situational usage there is a high degree of correspondence between this and its Lithuanian translation, while textual uses demonstrate low formal equivalence. A tendency to implicitate stems from the null subject construction and object ellipsis in Lithuanian and is also a result of the availability of facultative deictic words in Lithuanian. The apparent systemic difference between the deictic systems of English and Lithuanian indicates a tendency towards optional implicitation and stylistic variation in literary translation.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The study draws on Slobin’s Thinking-for-translating hypothesis, according to which translators tend to distance themselves from the source text in order to conform to the rhetorical style of the target language. Special attention is devoted to the role of visual language within this framework, with the ultimate aim of identifying translation techniques adapted to the issue of translating Manner-of-motion in comics, in both inter- and intratypological translation scenarios. This paper analyses a corpus that includes a selection from the Belgian comic series Les aventures de Tintin and its translation into two satellite-framed languages (English and German) and two verb-framed languages (Spanish and Catalan). Overall, the results highlight the key role of visual language in the translation of Manner-of-motion in comics, since this can compensate for alterations in the verbal code of target texts, by comparison with originals, and thus minimize the consequences of Thinking-for-translating. Moreover, the (limited) space in the balloons and the respective stylistic conventions of comic books in each language are shown to constrain translation to some extent.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Particular attention is given to (1) their overt realization with textual themes and pragmatic word order, and (2) the (non)adjacent positioning of discourse units realizing the relations. The methodological framework is an integrated one, supplementing Systemic Functional Grammar with Segmented Discourse Representation Theory. In the English and German narratives, there is a strong tendency to realize discourse relations overtly. The overall overt realization is significantly higher for narratives in both languages with editorials being significantly less overt. There are also significant differences in the overt realization of non-adjacently positioned units realizing discourse relations with significant distributions in all cases, although the distribution in the narratives is less significant.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

We focus on English sentences in which the location is expressed syntactically as the subject. The English constructions with a locative subject were detected as translation counterparts of Czech sentence-initial locative adverbials realized by prepositional phrases. Our study demonstrates that the potential of the sentence to introduce a new phenomenon in discourse is primarily based on the semantics of the verb.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

In so doing, three typologically distinct languages were examined: English, German and Greek. The empirical basis of this paper includes: (a) a corpus study, in which we examined the distribution of Goals in a small set of verbs, and (b) an experimental verbalization study, from which we elicited descriptions of different motion event types. While the former does not give a clear picture concerning the cross-linguistic differences in Goal prominence, the latter indicates that lexicalization pattern assumes a more prominent role than grammatical viewpoint aspect in affecting Goal realization.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Impersonal passives constitute one type of impersonal construction (denoting constructions with non-canonical subjects) as described in Siewierska (2008a:?116). Formally, they consist of an overt expletive subject, such as det ‘it’ in Swedish and er ‘there’ in Dutch, combined with a passive predicate. Semantically, such passive constructions encode actions with a general reference, i.e. where no agent is specified (cf. Siewierska 1984, Engdahl 2006, Viberg 2010). The study is corpus-based and uses a bidirectional translation corpus of Swedish and Dutch to map out the specific morphosyntactic and semantic profile of the impersonal passive in both Swedish and in Dutch. The similarities and differences make these languages suitable to study from a contrastive perspective in that interesting aspects on impersonal passives are highlighted in the translation data.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Crystal (2008) distinguishes two kinds of abbreviation: initialisms and acronyms. Article use in English is variable with both acronyms and initialisms used as proper names (e.g. (the) UKIP, at the UN vs. at MIT). The question is whether variability is largely dependent on the semantics of the underlying full form (i.e. whether this is derived from a proper name or common noun) or whether the two types of abbreviation show different behaviour with respect to variable article use. This paper uses data from CoStEP, a new, word-aligned version of EuroParl, and a data-driven approach to investigate variable article use with abbreviations and their full forms uttered by English native speakers and compares the findings to data from parallel German and Italian corpora. The results show higher article variability in English and a marked preference for and near categorical article use in German and Italian. Furthermore, our evidence confirms that acronyms tend towards the proper name end of the cline, while initialisms behave syntactically more like common nouns.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Despite the latter’s presence in the earliest Afrikaans data, it is argued not to have influenced the development of ('n) mens. This pronoun and Dutch een mens are also found to have syntactic functions other than subjecthood, unlike men. The contrast is attributed to their different degrees of grammaticalization. Lastly, the Afrikaans ‘man’-pronoun is shown to differ from its Dutch counterparts in relying on the second person singular for suppletion, though forms of ('n) mens are found to occasionally occur instead.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Descriptive analyses of the corpus are then presented and statistically validated with the help of univariate and multivariate analyses. The results are interpreted relative to our hypotheses and related to the following properties of texts in terms of lexical cohesion: semantic variability, cohesive strength, number and length of nominal chains, degree of specification of lexis, and degree of variation along all of these properties.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Two corpora have been used, a monolingual corpus of Children’s Short Stories, the CSS-corpus, and a parallel corpus English-Spanish, P-ACTRES 2.0.

The study is based on the analysis of a 625,000-word corpus comprising original and translated popular science texts in Slovene and the corresponding source texts in English and Italian. The results confirm that pronominal subjects are more frequent in translations from English, a non-null subject language; furthermore, they are more frequent in translations than in comparable originals.

When accounting for the differences, we consider prefixes semantically similar to u- (within one language and in both languages) that combine with the same base verbs forming either prefixed near-synonyms (e.g., blg. uvehna, zavehna, izvehna ‘wither, fade’; cro. umastiti, omastiti, zamastiti ‘grease, stain’) or prefixed verbs that are only seemingly near-synonyms (e.g., blg. uka?a ‘indicate, show’, oka?a se ‘turn out’; cro. ocrniti ‘denigrate, slander’, ucrniti (se) ‘color black, wear black’).

10.1075/lic.15016.sic;Eva Sicherl;A comparison of diminutive expressions in English and Slovene: as exemplified by Roald Dahl’s Matilda;2017;The article presents and compares ways of expressing diminution in English and Slovene nouns, verbs and adjectives with the aim of testing a hypothesis suggesting that Slovene uses diminutive forms more frequently than English. Depending on language typology, diminutiveness can be realized predominantly word-formationally or predominantly analytically. The hypothesis is tested against an analysis of diminutive forms used in Dahl’s Matilda and its Slovene translation, showing that Slovene indeed prefers to use diminutives more frequently than English. A tendency can be established for Slovene to form diminutives by word-formational means in the categories of noun and verb. In verbs, English tends towards neutrality of expression. Frequent use of multiple diminutiveness and the ability of analytic and synthetic diminutive forms to be freely interchangeable in Slovene testify to the strong presence of diminutive forms in the language system.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Building on previous studies on defective verbs in Spanish and Portuguese I investigate why there are no such defective verbs in Catalan. I conclude that the structure of the verbal paradigm in Catalan non-first conjugation verbs is radically different from that of the other languages; Catalan verbs constitute paradigms which correspond to regular patterns of inflection whereas Spanish and Portuguese display non-predictable types of root allomorphy which require all non-first conjugation verbs to have a memorised form for the rhizotonic forms of the verb.

Taking into account the sociolinguistic comparative method and on the basis of several representative corpora of the two languages in contact, the data from this research offer evidence that points to a notable congruence between the underlying grammars of both languages, which would, at least partially, account for a similar diffusion of these vernacular pluralizations. Moreover, some of the few cases of disagreement found can be explained on the basis of both internal (such as the existence of points of structural conflict in some verbal paradigms) and external factors (such as hypercorrection), which certain social groups particularly sensitive to normative pressure are more receptive to.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

It proposes that these constructions can be analyzed as cases of near-synonymy. Two of them are attested cross-linguistically: in the first, the modifiers function as predicative adjectives in impersonal copula clauses, while in the second, they are sentential adverbs. In the third type of construction, typical of the languages under investigation, the modifiers are followed by the complementizer que and introduce root clauses. The first part of the article describes the interpretive contrasts between the three constructions. The modifiers receive a different (inter)subjective reading depending on the construction in which they appear. Additionally, they operate on different levels of (non-)at-issue meaning. The second part of the article presents a quantitative study that complements the insights from the first part. In this empirical study, the influence of the text type, the modifier and the language on the choice of construction is modeled statistically. The results support the idea that the constructions are stylistic near-synonyms since their choice is strongly determined by the text type they appear in.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

At face value they are meant to elicit a response from a co-participant in the form of (dis)agreement with the proposition to which the tag has been added. Their pragmatic scope is, however, considerably broader: they serve as politeness strategies but also emphasize the speaker’s convictions or mark accusations. Like many other languages, Dutch does not have a similar structure, which raises questions as to what devices Dutch employs to serve the same purpose as question tags. This contrastive study examines such correspondents in a parallel corpus of English novels and their Dutch translations. Three structures can be identified: pragmatic markers, clause-final parentheticals and combinations of these. The data indicate a preference for pragmatic markers (most notably h? and toch), which predominantly appear either as invariant tags or clause-medially, indicating subtle shifts in utterance interpretation.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

It will be argued that for explaining the lack of English nouns corresponding to the German nouns under discussion contrasts in the history and the grammar of reciprocals are less relevant than (i) the availability of well-entrenched word-formation patterns, and (ii) the more significant role of ‘syntactic conversion’ in German.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Accompanying Arabic textual norms, e.g. (near-)synonym repetition and chained coordination, favour coordination while those of English favour subordination; 3. Further associated ‘rhetorical semantic’ uses of coordination are found in Arabic, e.g. hyperonym-hyponym repetition and associative repetition, which do not exist in English; 4.

A quantitative analysis based on 400 occurrences of the complements randomly selected from the newspaper genre shows that the indicative mood occurs more frequently than the subjunctive mood in both languages, although the subjunctive mood is more frequent in the Portuguese corpus than in the Spanish one. The analysis also shows that the occurrence of the subjunctive complement is highly restricted to contexts in which the subject of the main clause verb is either 1st person or 3rd person singular. From the theoretical perspective of Cognitive Grammar, the mood alternation is explained by the concept of dominion, i.e. the indicative complement designates an event that is located within the conceptualizer’s epistemic dominion, whereas the subjunctive complement designates an event that is located outside the conceptualizer’s dominion of effective control.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

In this paper, we assess the factors influencing implicitation by comparing the number of implicit and explicit translations of three polysemous French connectives in translated texts across three target languages: German, English and Spanish. Each connective can convey two discourse relations: one that can easily be conveyed implicitly and one that cannot be easily conveyed implicitly in monolingual data. Results indicate that relations that can easily be conveyed implicitly are also those that are most often left implicit in translation in all target languages. We discuss these results in view of the cognitive factors influencing the explicit or implicit communication of discourse relations.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

This paper offers a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the RMs found in a corpus of journalistic English and Spanish according to their different polyphonic arrangements. The theoretical framework used is a combination of insights from Relevance Theory — to explain the general role and the specific functions of RMs in the two languages —, and the Theory of Argumentation in Language — to account for their polyphonic meaning. The results show that instances of a high degree of polyphony are generally associated with particular discourse processes introduced by RMs, related to more interpretive uses such as definition, conclusion and consequence. However, significant differences emerge in the comparison of the specific RMs in English and in Spanish. Although the markers are often regarded as synonyms within each language or directly translatable from one language to another, their polyphonic potential may be considered a differentiating element between some of them.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Talmy’s (1985, 2000) influential two-way typology, verb-framed vs. satellite-framed patterns, represents the preferred option here for the encoding of motion events cross-linguistically, but does not cover other peripheral uses that a language may show.

The analysis of a large corpus sample of satellite-framed constructions shows that in Spanish this pattern is not only available but indeed is preferred under some circumstances. Previous assertions that Romance languages have poor lexical manner inventories and lack resultatives can help explain low productivity, but they do not argue against the existence of a satellite-framed encoding choice per se. By analysing naturally occurring constructions in their contexts, I will outline the pragmatic conditions that compensate for lexical and aspectual limitations.

In this article 20 Chilean and 20 Australian LTEs which contained the macro communicative intention of ‘thanking’ were analysed and compared with regard to the structural moves and Politeness Strategies (PS) they presented. The results show that addressers in both cultures follow a highly schematic way of constructing their Letters of Gratitude. This is evident not only in the sharing of most of their obligatory moves but also in that some of these moves present similar lexico-syntactic compositions to establish their limits. With regard to PS, the Chilean group showed the exclusive presence of strategies that acknowledged the role of the editor as a letter mediator directly. This suggests that the similarities found are genre-defining aspects. Conversely, the differences are connected to the cultural context of publication. The results also suggest that expressing gratitude in the written form may functionally differ from the way it is expressed orally. This type of contrastive study helps to identify both the genre- and culture specific aspects of discourse, which deepen our understanding of cultural, everyday manifestations and their realization in different settings.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

For this purpose the most popular animal metaphors in both languages are compared and contrasted. The animals are mostly those with which we have close contact in our daily lives. It is believed that if we could learn how metaphors have originated across languages we could find some explanations for similarities and differences of the metaphorical meanings across languages and cultures. Contrasting the origins of metaphorical concepts is believed to be an appropriate framework for this goal. The results of this study reflect how English and Persian people conceptualize their surrounding world across cultures and how they lexicalize them. It is found that although the physical characteristics and behaviour of animals are the basis for the metaphorical applications or interpretations of animal terms, they are not the only determining factor. The other factors in metaphorical meanings of animal names are culture, language-specificity, and also those behavioural characteristics of animals which are attributed to culture (culturally salient features).;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

It reports on a programmatic study of the ways in which impersonalization is expressed in English and German. Impersonalization is taken to be epitomized by human impersonal pronouns like German man (e.g. Man lebt nur einmal ‘You/one only live(s) once’). English does not have a specialized impersonal pronoun like Germ. man and uses a variety of strategies instead. The question arises what determines the choice of a given impersonalization strategy in English. Drawing on relevant theoretical work and using data from a translation corpus (Europarl), variables potentially affecting the distribution of impersonalization strategies in English are identified, and their influence on the choice of a strategy is determined. By testing hypotheses derived from theoretical work and using multivariate quantitative methods of analysis, the study is intended to illustrate how bridges can be built between fine-grained semantic analyses, on the one hand, and more coarse-grained, but empirically valid, corpus research, on the other.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The results show, inter alia, that English V1-conditionals are highly divergent from polar interrogatives and occupy a functional niche with respect to ‘if-’conditionals, with their German counterparts showing more transitional characteristics in both respects; they also suggest a special role for V1-protases with ‘should/sollte’ in expressing a subtype of neutral, rather than tentative, conditionality. Finally, prospects are discussed for future research regarding possible synchronic (i.e. discourse-functional) and diachronic (i.e. systemic) motivations for the differences and similarities observed between V1-conditionals in the two present-day languages.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

After an overview of the recent literature on contrastive morphology and the relevant ‘tertia comparationis’ in Section?2, Section?3 focuses on the main differences between compounding in Modern Greek and Italian (e.g. the position of the morphological head, the pattern stem+stem in Modern Greek vs. the pattern word+word in Italian). The diachronic dimension, the inflectional system and the role of syntax are put forward as explanatory factors for the differences between the two languages. Two recent types of compounds, [V+V] V in Modern Greek and [V+N] N in Italian, are therefore examined contrastively. The contrastive analysis of compounding is based on three types of equivalence: ‘system equivalence’, ‘rule equivalence’, and ‘morphological age equivalence’. The main conclusion is that a contrastive approach to morphology enables us to deepen our understanding of both the fundamental distinction and the fundamental interconnection between morphology and syntax.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The focus will mainly be on the independent realizations of conjunctions in Spanish, but data from Catalan and Italian will also be analyzed, in order to show that the ways of encoding the speaker’s point of view and source of information vary across different languages. My hypothesis is that the existence of structures which combine this conjunction with evidential and polarity adverbs derives from the discourse properties of these syntactic categories. The conjunction itself can be used not only to mark subordination but also as a discourse marker, enabling the speaker to recall previously shared information or knowledge.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

However, it is unclear whether, given this syntactic variation, such constructions show equivalence in semantic function. For this purpose, a corpus-based contrastive analysis of these genitive constructions in a bilingual novel is carried out. As a prelude to a quantitative and qualitative inspection of the data, the (non)interchangeability of the alternative English genitives is determined by eliciting intuitive judgments from 10 linguistically na?ve native speakers of British English. Quantitatively, the study shows that the Arabic genitive almost covers the semantic functions expressed by the various English genitives found in the corpus. Qualitatively, the study reveals that the flexibility derived from the English genitive variation, as opposed to the fixed word order of the Arabic genitive, allows the speaker to convey additional meaning. However, the Arabic genitive which employs various formal devices such as overt markers of case, gender, number, definiteness and person can express the same semantic functions. These features render Arabic functional with one genitive and require English to vary its genitive relative to certain phonological, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic conditions.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Both English “for * sake” and Norwegian for * skyld have been attested with the following meanings: purpose, consideration and annoyance (used as an expletive). An analysis of bidirectional translation corpus data reveals marked cross-linguistic differences in the frequency and use of the patterns, contributing to a fair amount of non-correspondence in translation between the two languages. The in-depth contrastive analysis undertaken confirms that the two patterns behave differently in the two languages: while English prefers the expletive use, Norwegian prefers the purpose use. This observation regarding the patterns’ conditions of use led to the conclusion that the two languages operate with two different extended units of meaning, and that the two patterns as such are not considered perfect translation equivalents of each other. It was therefore interesting to take a closer look at one of the patterns — the English expletive use — and its actual correspondences in Norwegian. The cross-linguistic investigation uncovers some evidence of “quasi-swearing” in the translated texts and some evidence of different ways of swearing in English in Norwegian, both in terms of how expletives are lexicalized and what they refer to, e.g. blasphemy or sexual blatancy.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

In this study, we examine whether the different lexicalisation patterns for motion events in English and Spanish also carry over into the domain of vision. In particular, we explore visual Path complexity, the semantic specificity of Manner of vision verbs, and the translation of visual Paths and Manner of vision from English into Spanish.

Moreover, it provides interesting insights into further cross-linguistic differences in terms of Manner of vision granularity.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Debonding is a type of degrammaticalization defined by Norde as “a composite change whereby a bound morpheme in a specific linguistic context becomes a free morpheme” (Norde, 2009:?186). We investigate for each of the three languages how the debonding process is impacted by three different factors: (1) the semantics of the noun subject to debonding, (2) the degree of prosodic and morphological cohesion of the sequence, (3) the presence of adjective inflection in the language. It is furthermore argued that in the case of Dutch, an additional process should be taken into account, that is the possibility of clipping of N+A compounds (e.g. stapel “lit. pile; madly in love” < stapelverliefd “lit. pile-in love; madly in love”).";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

It is generally accepted that Portuguese and Spanish exhibit a high degree of syntactic equivalence. However, the nature of the infinitive in the two languages is quite different, displaying more verbal characteristics in Portuguese than in Spanish. By means of a detailed empirical study, this article examines whether this structural difference has an effect on the syntax of the causatives with deixar and dejar. Indeed, statistically the selection of the different complement types (finite clause vs. infinitive, with an anteposed or postposed causee) differs substantially in the two languages. A multifactorial analysis shows to what extent the degree of dynamicity of the main constituents, namely the causer, the causee and the caused event, determine the syntactic variation in the two languages and how this variation can be linked to the different grammatical status of the infinitive.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Using bottom-up statistical analyses, these studies have investigated specific patterns of register variation in several different discourse domains of English, as well as the more general patterns of register variation in many different languages. Each study identifies linguistic dimensions that are peculiar to that particular language/domain. However, the more theoretically interesting finding is that linguistically similar dimensions emerge in nearly all of these studies. Two of these dimensions are especially robust, making them strong candidates for universal dimensions of register variation: 1) a fundamental opposition between clausal/‘oral’ discourse vs. phrasal/‘literate’ discourse, and 2) the opposition between narrative vs. non-narrative discourse. The present paper introduces the methodology of Multi-Dimensional analysis and surveys the research studies carried out to date, with an emphasis on these potentially universal patterns of register variation.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The approach is exemplified with the help of sample analyses of the English-German CroCo Corpus, a corpus containing originals and translations from eight different registers. In order to account for the systematic contrastive differences in frequencies of compared features, the magnitude of difference between register-specific and register-neutral frequencies is contrasted.

Some guidelines are presented to help solve some of the methodological challenges posed by a cross-linguistic comparison of lexical bundles.

The corpus study reveals frequency differences in the use of initial adjuncts across the languages, which are to some extent connected with an overall greater frequency of adjuncts in Norwegian. While initial adjuncts in fiction often signal cohesive relations, those in news are more typically due to backgrounding of less important information or to framing/scene-setting for the clause message. Norwegian initial adjuncts are even less likely than English ones to convey new information; on the other hand, initial position is to a lesser extent associated with contrastive focus in Norwegian. This, together with the higher frequency of initial adjuncts in Norwegian, suggests that initial placement of adjuncts carries a lower degree of markedness in Norwegian than in English.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Against this background, the present paper provides a contrastive study of the lexical semantics of the Swedish posture verbs sitta ‘sit’, st? ‘stand’ and ligga ‘lie’ based on the Multilingual Parallel Corpus (MPC), which contains extracts from Swedish novels and their published translations into English, German, French and Finnish. Since the corpus is a very rich data source, the study is focused on the use of posture verbs as locative verbs. It turns out that it is possible to arrange the languages along a continuum with respect to the use of posture verbs versus the copula to describe the location of inanimate objects. In Finnish the copula dominates completely, in English there is more of a balance (in this kind of written text), whereas the posture verbs dominate in German and Swedish. French stands out as a completely different type in this comparison, since the copula is used very little and posture verbs hardly at all. Actually, there is a tension in French between the use of a small number of verbs with a general locative meaning as translations and the use of a large variety of reflexive verbs and resultative constructions with past participles (e.g. ?tre fix? ‘be attached’) which convey fine-grained information about the placement. Among the languages that use posture verbs as locative predicates, there is a general similarity with respect to the factors that condition the choice between lie and stand, whereas even closely related Germanic languages differ with respect to the semantic factors that condition the choice of sit as a locative predicate.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The markers are identified among the Czech counterparts of the individual semantic sub-classes of English copular verbs, and subsequently used to trace other, structurally diverse, English constructions which convey the same meaning as the copulas in question (constructions expressing epistemic stance or resultative meaning). Since the repertoire of copular verbs is much narrower in Czech than in English, the translation counterparts display a variety of formally divergent means rendering into Czech the meanings conveyed by the English copulas. The overt counterparts which are closely associated with a particular semantic group of copulas, and structurally as well as semantically sufficiently unambiguous, can serve as markers.

The concept of ‘overness’ is a relational one, the basic spatial sense of which involves some sort of (elongated) superiority of a Figure (a Trajector in the terminology employed by cognitive linguists) vis-?-vis a Ground. This study compares codings in English and French of this concept as it is instantiated in translations of the same original Norwegian texts. The data for the study are taken from the Oslo Multilingual Corpus. Tokens coding motion events are analysed in detail in terms of the coding of Manner, Path, Site and Ground. The results of the study point to substantial differences between English and French in their codings of motion events, with English conforming by and large to the satellite-framed language type.

Both languages have a set of verbs that may enter into both patterns, as illustrated in the title by ‘find’ and in Norwegian by finne. On the basis of material drawn from the extended fiction version of the English-Norwegian Parallel Corpus, it can be established that the two languages operate differently with regard to the frequency and use of the patterns. The investigation focuses on four verbs in particular, pour, ta ‘take’, find and finne ‘find’, with the aim of establishing to what extent the two patterns exist side by side within the two languages, to what extent they are interchangeable in text, and to what extent they correspond to each other cross-linguistically. While the study reveals that they do exist side by side, a more complex picture emerges with regard to how interchangeable they are and to what extent they correspond to each other across the languages. As the patterns as such do not seem to have a uniform meaning, the verb becomes all the more important for the choice of the reflexive vs. the non-reflexive pattern.

In addition, the English texts contain a large number of omissions and unidentifiable sources (zero). The most common function of g?rna is to express willingness or readiness on the part of the subject, but in the absence of a volitional controller it can also indicate a habitual tendency and even convey implications such as reluctance. It is also used in speech acts expressing offers, promises and requests and in responses to such speech acts. To compare the Swedish adverb with its German cognate gern(e) a similar contrastive study of the English correspondences of this adverb was made on the basis of the Oslo Multilingual Corpus.

10.1075/lic.13.1.01bis;Mario Bisiada;Changing conventions in German causal clause complexes: A diachronic corpus study of translated and non-translated business articles;2013;This paper contributes to the field of diachronic corpus studies of linguistic change through language contact in translation by replicating Becher’s (2011) study which found a trend from hypotaxis to parataxis in concessive clause complexes of German popular scientific articles, and examining whether a comparable trend can be found in causal clause complexes in another genre. The study draws on a one-million-word translation corpus of English business articles and their German translations, as well as on a comparable corpus of German non-translations. The corpora consist of texts published in two time periods, 1982–3 and 2008. German translations of English causal conjunctions are compared for both time periods to determine diachronic changes in causal clause complexes. The comparable corpus is then analysed to find out whether those changes also happened in non-translated language. While a trend from hypotaxis to parataxis in both corpora can be observed, hypotaxis remains more frequent than parataxis. The study also detects a shift in preference for the causal conjunctions weil, denn and da, which partly causes the decrease in hypotaxis.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Pastor; Miguel ?ngel Candel Mora";Variation in the translation patterns of English complex noun phrases into Spanish in a specific domain;2013;This paper focuses on a functionalist analysis of the patterns followed when translating specific texts from English into Spanish. The original texts are written in English and, afterwards, translated to other languages. In this process, lexical variation may appear. The main objectives of this study are to determine whether English noun phrases have different lexical equivalents when translated into Spanish and whether this depends on the position of the head in the complex noun phrase. Other objectives of this paper are, on the one hand, to detect the role of the head and modifiers in English complex noun phrases when translated into the target language, and, on the other hand, to determine whether the specificity of nouns could be the cause of variation. The answer to these research questions will be useful for translators, communication specialists and scientists who use English and Spanish to communicate.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.13.1.03haf;Marianne Hob?k Haff;Counterfactual conditionals in focus: A contrastive analysis of French and Norwegian;2013;This article is a comparative exploration of counterfactual conditionals introduced by the conjunction ‘if’ in French and Norwegian, a topic which has not been studied before. My analyses are based on examples from monolingual and multilingual corpora, complemented by two questionnaires, in French and Norwegian, respectively. Both languages have two main patterns corresponding to (A) [‘if’ + imperfect + conditional simple] and (B) [‘if’ + pluperfect + conditional perfect], but their use is somewhat different in the two languages. Regarding counterfactual present, both have two patterns at their disposal. In French, however, pattern (A) seems preferred whereas Norwegian displays a clear preference for pattern (B). When confronted with examples of counterfactual future, both groups of informants initially hesitated, but ultimately considered pattern (B) as an acceptable solution in many cases. Not only the tenses but also the type of verb, eventual temporal adjuncts and the context are important for the interpretations. Neither French nor Norwegian grammars present the issue satisfactorily and therefore need to be revised.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.13.1.04laa;Anu Laanemets;The passive voice in spoken and written Danish, Norwegian and Swedish: A comparative corpus-based study;2013;Taking a comparative corpus-based approach, the article examines the use of the passive voice in Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish written as well as spoken language. More specifically, we measure the relative frequency of the passive voice in general and in its two forms — periphrastic and morphological — within two written and two oral genres. Although we find differences in the relative frequency of the passive voice, with Danish and Norwegian being more similar than Swedish, the basic pattern is identical across the three languages. Situational and stylistic factors — especially the degree of formality — appear more important for the choice of passive voice than the distinction between written and spoken media. More formal genres use more passive voice and have a preference for the morphological passive, whereas less formal genres tend to use less passive voice with the periphrastic passive playing a relatively more prominent role.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.13.1.05lee;Tong King Lee;Author manifestation and perceptions of self in Chinese academic discourse: Comparisons with English;2013;This paper examines the manifestation of authorial identity in research articles by contrasting the phenomenon across two languages (English and Chinese) and three fields (Literature, Education, Chemistry). The study seeks to find patterns governing the use of self-mention devices among native Chinese and English writers, and to explain such patterns in terms of the Chinese perception of self. Based on a corpus-based investigation of pronominal and depersonalized forms of self-mention involving 180 research articles, the paper suggests that Chinese authors have a stronger tendency to use depersonalized forms over pronominal forms than their English counterparts. It is also found that in using first-person pronouns, Chinese authors in single-authored papers have a salient preference for the plural form, in particular the inclusive plural pronoun as compared to English authors. The paper attempts to link the linguistic phenomenon to the concept of the interdependent self inherent in Chinese social psychology, and proposes possible applications to research in bilingual scholarly writing and academic translation.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

We describe the temporal and modal uses of ‘be + -ing’ and investigate to what extent they overlap with the uses of ?tre + en train de. The observation that the use of the French present progressive is not obligatory and more restricted than that of the present progressive in English is taken as a sign of a less advanced stage of grammaticalization of the former. On the other hand, the two progressive constructions are alike in that they turn out to share the same basic, modal meaning, which we define as epistemic contingency in current reality. This meaning is, among other things, reflected in the (inter)subjective connotations that are often associated with the progressives.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

To that end, data from several corpora of contemporary spoken English and Spanish are analysed in a number of ways, including the frequency of this construction in the two languages, the basic elements of its syntactic structure, and the semantic and informative constraints which operate in the existential/presentational construction. This study also deals with the degree of variation which these sentences exhibit and how this affects the selection of the marker of the construction (‘there’, hay), agreement between the marker or the verb and the postverbal noun phrase, the accommodation of additional constituents such as locative phrases or nominal postmodifiers and complements, the so-called indefiniteness restriction, and the compliance with general informative principles to which English and Spanish are claimed to be subject. A corpus-based contrastive methodology leads both to a prototypical and to a language-specific description of the existential construction in English and Spanish, in which the notion of grammatical, semantic and informative versatility plays a significant role.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

This study compares existential constructions in a sample of English and Swedish source texts and their translations in the English Swedish Parallel Corpus. The Swedish sample contains a slightly higher number of existential constructions. About two thirds are translated into or from existential constructions in the other language. The remaining correspondences differ somewhat in terms of where they place the newsworthy content presented by the notional subject in the existential construction. In English, this is often placed in the Theme. In Swedish, in contrast, this is usually avoided, either by fronting another clause element or by realizing the content as a complement or verb, which is placed in the Rheme. These findings provide further empirical evidence for the claim that Swedish follows the information principle more closely than English.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

In addition, a descriptive study of actual translations provides a broader picture of the degree of translatability between the languages under investigation.

10.1075/lic.12.2.05sio;Athina Sioupi;A cross-linguistic investigation of the combinational possibilities of the ‘for X time’ adverbial with different aspectual verb classes;2012;The paper observes that the Vendler classification is not sufficient as a classification of verbs, since it cannot explain why some telic verbs, such as change of state (COS) verbs and degree achievements (DAs) appear with the durational adverbial (d-adverbial) ‘for X time’ in Greek, in English and in German, while some atelics like semelfactives appear with the frame adverbial (f-adverbial) se X ora (‘in X time’) in Greek. In the spirit of Iatridou et al. (2003) it is proposed that the d-adverbial ‘for X time’ tests not only for (a)telicity but also for (im)perfectivity. It also argues that the two d-adverbials in Greek ja X ora and epi X ora (‘for X time’) are to be found with different grammatical (viewpoint) aspect: the former with perfective aspect and the latter with imperfective aspect. This is due to the fact that the ja X ora gives not only durative temporal information but also a lexical aspectual one, while the epi X ora gives only a durative temporal.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

However, few studies have assessed the magnitude and the causes of these divergences. In this paper, we provide an overview of the similarities and discrepancies between causal connectives in two typologically related languages: English and French. We first discuss two criteria used in the literature to account for these differences: the notion of domains of use and the information status of the cause segment. We then test the validity of these criteria through an empirical contrastive study of causal connectives in English and French, performed on a bidirectional corpus. Our results indicate that French and English connectives have only partially overlapping profiles and that translation equivalents are adequately predicted by these two criteria.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.12.2.08mik;Tamara Mikolic Juznic;A contrastive study of nominalization in the systemic functional framework;2012;This paper presents a contrastive analysis of nominalization in Italian and Slovene within the framework of systemic functional grammar as described by M.A.K. Halliday and his colleagues. Nominalization is viewed as a type of grammatical metaphor whereby processes which are congruently realized by verbs are metaphorically realized by nouns expressing the same process as those verbs. The frequency of nominalization varies greatly among languages as well as among genres within a language, and may cause problems when two languages interact, e.g. in translation, especially when one of the two languages seems less prone to use this kind of grammatical metaphor than the other. In the present study, an analysis is carried out of a 2.5 million-token parallel corpus of Italian source texts and their Slovene translations, particularly with regard to the different translation equivalents that may appear in the translated texts, which is partly dependent of the type of process involved.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

10.1075/lic.12.1.02kon;Ekkehard K?nig;Contrastive linguistics and language comparison;2012;After receiving enthusiastic support during the 1960s and 1970s, the program of ‘Contrastive linguistics’ led a somewhat modest, if not marginal, existence during the two subsequent decades. The main reason for the apparent failure of this program was, of course, that the high hopes seen in its potential for making foreign language teaching more efficient were disappointed. Empirical work on the process of L2-acquisition from different native languages as starting points showed that contrastive linguistics cannot simply be equated with a theory of foreign language acquisition. A second problem was that a central aspect of the contrastive program, i.e. the writing of comprehensive contrastive grammars for language pairs, was hardly ever properly implemented. Finally, there was the problem of finding a place for contrastive linguistics within the spectrum of language comparison, relative to other comparative approaches to linguistic analysis. It is the third of these issues that is addressed by the present article. It will be shown that only by relating contrastive linguistics to other subfields of comparative linguistics and by delimiting it from them will we obtain a clear picture of its agenda, its potential and its limits.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

There may be some merit in expanding the scope of the enterprise to include contrastive investigations of grammatical systems with respect to how they change over time. Full understanding of some contrasts between grammars requires reference to the diachronic axis. This paper illustrates the point with one particular case in the Germanic languages, involving parallel instances of reanalysis of relative pronouns as relative complementizers in Yiddish, Afrikaans and Gothic. These parallel changes, operating on grammatical systems with slight differences in initial conditions, yield sharply different outcomes.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

It is argued that the fact that the possible grammatical choices are more restricted within a dialectal domain is not due to a supposed principled difference in the parameters that rule variation. Rather, they are a function of the originally unitary lexicon dialects share. If language variation is essentially located in the functional items, and they are derived from the same lexicon, then they will share some core properties that make dialectal variation so restricted. I propose that the fact that the lexicon is similar can give us clues about the internal structure of syntactically complex elements which are represented by a single word, like quantifiers, wh-items, modal verbs, etc. Within a homogenous domain, structural complexity correlates with a higher number of lexical roots: the higher the number of the lexical roots found, the more complex internal structure the functional item will display.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The study is based on three balanced comparable corpora which represent British English, native Chinese and translational Chinese in addition to an English-Chinese parallel corpus which provides a basis for comparing native and translated English and investigating explicitation in translation. Our results show that word clusters are substantially more common in translated Chinese, suggesting a tendency in translations to use fixed and semi-fixed recurring patterns in an attempt to achieve improved fluency. The more frequent use of word clusters, especially those of high frequency and high coverage in translational Chinese, is also likely to be a result of the influence of the English source language because word clusters are significantly more prevalent in native English in relation to native Chinese. Chinese and English tend to use reformulation markers of different styles while on the other hand, reformulation markers are generally more common in both translated English and translated Chinese than in their native counterparts, suggesting that reformulation markers function as a strategy for explicitation in translations, which tend to use oral, stylistically simpler forms than non-translated texts.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

This paper aims to combine two different methodological approaches to the study of meaning (Manca 2008, 2009): the Corpus Linguistics approach within the framework of John Sinclair’s view of language (1991, 1996) and the Intercultural Studies approach based on Hall’s ([1976] 1989) theories and Katan’s (2004, 2006) framework of High and Low Context Cultures features in transactional communication. The two levels of analysis allow the researcher to carry out both a quantitative and qualitative analysis. Examples that show the validity of this combined approach will be derived from a number of corpora of different subsections of the British and Italian languages of tourism. We will see that the two cultures tend to adopt different types of promotion in terms of linguistic devices (for example use of concrete nouns vs. abstract nouns) and features of description along a continuum which sees at one extreme explicitness and simple facts and at the other extreme implicitness, feelings and opinions.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Despite the acknowledgment of this dual grounding (Sinha, 1999), cross-linguistic studies addressing the significance of cultural factors to form specialised concepts through metaphor are still rare. Research is even scarcer when it comes to terminological resemblance metaphor. To fill this gap, this paper examines a set of resemblance metaphor term pairs in English and Spanish, which had been retrieved from a corpus of marine biology texts extracted from academic journals. Based on the analysis of these terms, we propose a typology of metaphors which classifies them according to their level of socio-cognitive situatedness. This typology shows that: (i) sensorimotor perception and sociocultural factors merge into a physical-social experience that shapes scientific knowledge through metaphor, and (ii) sociocognitive patterns involved in terminological metaphor formation give rise to inter-linguistic variation and commonalities.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

They claim this distinction is crosslinguistically viable and explains the syntactic behavior of these predicates. Based on work done by Smith (1970) and Wright (2001), this paper argues for an extension of Levin and Rappaport’s binary classification. Instead, I propose a continuum resulting from the analysis of corpora in English and Spanish for verbs that would enter the binary categories advanced by Levin and Rappaport. One of the problematic pairs of verbs for their classification when applied to Spanish, florecer ‘to bloom’ and marchitar(se) ‘to wilt’ is analyzed in detail. The continuum proposed here extends Levin and Rappaport’s categories and takes into account the locus of control of the change and whether external factors may be necessary conditions for the change to occur. In particular, this new focus can account for the presence or absence of the clitic se with some of the predicates in Spanish.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The main assumption is that punning in the two languages differs in quantity and quality because of contrasts in morphosyntax, lexis and phonology. More precisely, given that the creation of most types of paronomastic jokes is considered to be facilitated in English, the English data set is expected to show a higher number and a greater variation of puns. However, a few manifestations of punning are assumed to occur particularly often in the German data. Seven hypotheses related to these predictions are tested.

These factors were considered both individually and in relation to one another.

Our discussion centres on some of the central methodological and theoretical issues involved in contrastive lexical morphology, an area which, to date, has largely remained under-researched. Precise defining criteria for derivative (and prefix) status are presented in order to decide what counts as a derivative (or as a prefix) and what does not. Emphasis is also put on a fined-grained semantic tertium comparationis elaborated for the cross-linguistic investigation of lexical morphology and based on a six-tiered semantic categorisation, viz. location, evaluation, negation, quantity, modality, and inchoativity, most of which are further divided into finer subcategories.

10.1075/lic.11.1.10tri;Elena Tribushinina;Boundedness and relativity: A contrastive study of English and Russian;2011;It is often assumed that relative adjectives (e.g. ‘long’, ‘old’) evoke unbounded scales and are, therefore, incompatible with maximizers (e.g. ‘completely’) and approximators (e.g. ‘almost’). In contrast, absolute adjectives which are felicitous with maximizers (e.g. ‘completely full’) and approximators (e.g. ‘almost full’) are argued to trigger bounded scales. This paper investigates whether the semantic typology of gradable adjectives developed for Germanic languages can be extended to non-Germanic languages by comparing the distribution of relative adjectives with totality modifiers in English and Russian corpora. In line with previous research, the corpus analysis shows that English relative adjectives are associated with fully unbounded scales and are very infrequent in combination with maximizers and approximators. In contrast, Russian relative adjectives evoke half-bounded scales. Therefore, relative adjectives denoting less of a property (e.g. korotkij “short”, de??vyj “cheap”) are quite frequently modified by maximizing adverbs in Russian. However, unlike maximum-standard absolute adjectives, Russian relative adjectives are incompatible with approximators. It is concluded that there is no universal one-to-one relationship between adjective types and scale types.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

10.1075/lic.10.2.03bee;Kate Beeching;Semantic change: Evidence from false friends;2010;Functional linguists are in general agreement that semantic change may be triggered as part of the negotiation of meaning in interactional contexts: a ‘one-off’ contextual implicature generalises to become a new core meaning of a lexical item (Traugott and Dasher, 2002). In what ways, however, does the ‘one-off’ contextual implicature arise? Why would one language develop one aspect of meaning and another a different one? And how or why does it generalise and become a coded part of the structure of that particular language? Hansen (2008:?228) notes that “close crosslinguistic comparisons of the polysemies of semantically related items […] should turn out to be highly relevant” in this respect. ‘False friends’, forms deriving from a common etymon which have developed different meanings in different languages, offer useful insights. This paper presents lexicographic and spoken synchronic data on two false friends in French and English, effectivement/‘effectively’ and finalement/‘finally’, and explores the cognitive processes involved in their recruitment for interactional functions. The factors which are influential in the development of hedging usages of the terms are overviewed and the contribution that a detailed synchronic study of the semantics of false friends can make to the study of semantic change is evaluated.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

In most cases they are ‘false friends’, as they overlap in meaning in a very limited number of contexts only. Since these words can — directly or indirectly (through borrowing) — be traced back to the same origin, their present-day meanings indicate that the words have followed different paths of change. It is the aim of the present article to trace the semantic-pragmatic developments of these words through a detailed examination of the discursive contexts in which they have occurred from their first attestations in the languages concerned until the present time. In this way, the subtle transitions from one meaning to another are laid bare. In addition, the cross-linguistic perspective offers insight into how polysemy may develop in different directions. The analyses are based on French and English monolingual corpus data, both synchronic and diachronic. In addition, translation corpus data provide further evidence for the semantics of the two adverbs. The results of the empirical analysis are interpreted within the framework of pragmaticalization and (inter)subjectification.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

This article sets forth a quantitative analysis, based on naturally-occurring linguistic data, of the distribution of these functions for both adverbs. Apart from distributional differences between the two adverbs and between their occurrences in spoken and written language, the results show that when they are modifiers of words or Verbal Group-oriented Adjuncts, their main function is to qualify (part of) the propositional content of the utterance; however, when they are clausal Adjuncts or (parts of) minor clauses, they are often geared to the performance of discourse functions such as contrast, concession or agreement. These functions are shared with some adverbs of certainty such as ‘certainly’ or ‘definitely’, which suggests that the semantic difference between degree and certainty tends to be blurred when adverbs of maximal strength of both types are used for performing discourse functions that enhance assertiveness.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

We focus on the case of items coming from verbs meaning ‘to look’, in a semasiological perspective: Spanish and Catalan mira, Portuguese olha, Italian guarda, French regarde, Romanian uite. We show that they all share many uses, among which turn-taking, introduction of reported speech, hesitation phenomenon, topic-shifting and modalization, except for French regarde. We then establish (against Waltereit, 2002) that the development of these uses is the result of a process of grammaticalization, from lexical, clause-internal uses to uses as discourse markers, in a cline which tends to confirm the predictions made by Brinton and Traugott (2005). The lesser grammaticalization of French regarde could seem unimportant, but is in apparent contradiction with the now well-established fact that French is, of all Romance languages, the most grammaticalized. We try, in conclusion, to address this paradox: is French not so grammaticalized after all, or is this just an exception to the rule?;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The comparison of coordinate constructions in the two languages involves the semantic types of coordination, the scope of coordinators in the two languages, the number and position of coordinators in coordinate constructions.

By analyzing parallel corpora of English and Persian texts from the areas of education and psychology, the paper seeks to reveal that translation as a language contact phenomenon influences not only the grammatical and semantic categories of the target language, it also leaves some traces of the impact of the source language on the discourse-pragmatics of the target language. This in turn leads to a kind of stylistic variation triggered by the source language. One of the main arguments adduced is that such a replication is based on the cultural filters operating in the replica language. In other words, the borrowed elements show a kind of innovative adaptation to the new environment to resolve their clashes with the target language. Thus the paper primarily focuses on the influence on Persian, through translation, of the English passive construction, as well as its deictic terms of first personal pronouns.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

By means of a corpus study on prepositional clauses introduced by para in Spanish and Portuguese, the present paper shows that translations can also be a valuable methodological tool for the study of grammatical phenomena in a given language. The results from both a translation and a comparable Portuguese/Spanish and Spanish/Portuguese corpus are shown to converge and reveal that the inflection of the Portuguese infinitive is used to strengthen thematic continuity, whereas an overt subject appears in cases of inaccessibility within the sentence margins. The present study therefore deepens former accounts on the nature of the Portuguese inflected infinitive and the Spanish and Portuguese para-clauses in general by comparing translations in both languages.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The examples are classified into five different uses according to certain formal and contextual criteria. The two words are shown to have obvious functional similarities: in each of the categories distinguished then and d? are the preferred translation equivalents of each other. But there are also striking differences. Swedish d? is generally much more common than English then and the latter is often left out in the English translations. In other words, the use of an explicit conclusion marker is more often felt to be redundant in English than in Swedish. The two words also display positional differences. For example, unlike then, Swedish d? cannot occur initially in non-declarative clauses and its use as an unstressed pragmatic particle is confined to clause-final position. Another notable feature is that an unstressed particle in the original text (in both languages) is sometimes rendered by a stressed adverb in the translation, a tendency which suggests that the distinction between stressed anaphoric adverb and unstressed pragmatic particle is blurred and a matter of degree rather than a clear-cut dichotomy.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.9.2.01hun;Matthias H?ning;Semantic niches and analogy in word formation: Evidence from contrastive linguistics;2009;Word formation, like other lexical phenomena, seems to be a difficult terrain for contrastive linguistics since it hardly allows for significant and insightful generalizations about the differences between two languages, as has been stated in the literature more than once. This paper investigates one factor leading to morphological differences and contrasts between historically related languages (Dutch and German). It is argued that word formation processes often show semantic fragmentation: in the course of time they develop ‘semantic niches’, i.e. groups of words (subsets of a morphological category) kept together by formal and semantic criteria and extendable via analogy. When looking at word formation from a contrastive point of view, these niches seem to allow for better generalizations in terms of systematic correspondences and differences between two languages than the category as a whole. As a consequence, productivity should not be seen as an absolute notion, but rather as a local and gradual phenomenon. Morphology should not only account for the possibility of coining new words but also for their probability, because language comparison shows that even allegedly equivalent word formation processes often differ with respect to the probability of their use. The paper therefore argues in favour of an analogy approach that takes the existence of semantic niches seriously.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Both monolingual and translated data is investigated. It shows that there is no equivalence between the two periphrases in such a constrained syntactic environment. The sequence if + be going to, which is not truly conditional as claimed throughout the analysis, is frequent in contemporary English, whereas aller + infinitive is hardly compatible with conditionals. Be going to in if-clauses is thus mainly translated by devoir, which emphasizes the inevitability component of the English periphrasis, or by vouloir when the intentional meaning of be going to is foregrounded. It is nevertheless argued that aller + infinitive can occur in conditionals, but only in very specific situations: when the si-clause is clearly attributable to a source of disourse distinct from the speaker.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Quantitative analysis revealed two discourse patterns. Spanish authors preferred a progressive style characterized by considerable initial background information, and a commentary opening with a statement of result and ending with the main claim. In contrast, most translations exhibited a retrogressive style with little or no background information, and the main claim located early or at the start. The Spanish texts showed a highly cohesive thematic pattern, most within-paragraph links being with the immediately preceding theme or rheme, whereas the translations, influenced by the source texts, contained comparatively more distant links, thus creating thematic ‘jumps’. Thematic progression was independent of discourse pattern. Qualitative analysis identified a number of strategies that can help translators align their texts with the target language norm for theme–rheme progression.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

10.1075/lic.9.1.02bec;Annette Becker;Modality and ENGAGEMENT in British and German political interviews;2009;Speakers regulary use modality and other resources from the appraisal system of engagement to position themselves intersubjectively. In doing so, they modify the discursive space for the voices of others. This is particularly relevant in political media interviews, especially in questions with topics that are potentially face-threatening to the interviewees’ public face. This paper compares the use of modality and other engagement resources in British and German political interviews and discusses the differences in frequency and function. Data is taken from videotaped and transcribed political interviews conducted during British and German election night broadcasts. Their analysis is based on recent studies in contrastive pragmatics, appraisal theory and pragmatically oriented studies on media discourse, bearing in mind that cross-cultural comparison of data taken from a particular genre has to take into account a broad range of contextual factors including genre-specific constraints.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The relation between inference and epistemic modality is discussed both semantically and syntactically. Modal adverbs license double modality in French, in contrast to their English counterparts. This different syntactic behaviour confirms that the distinction that is generally made between two modal functions — the identificative one and the restrictive one — is relevant to French modal adverbs, but not to English modal adverbs. However, this semantic difference needs to be revisited and backed up pragmatically. It is argued that the identificative function of modal adverbs should be redefined in terms of intersubjectivity. While ‘apparently’ and ‘obviously’ mark the speaker’s identification with the addressee’s point of view, apparemment and ?videmment are shown to be able to express the speaker’s evaluation whatever the speaker and addressee’s common knowledge might be. This pragmatic difference in turn provides an explanation for the different constraints on the use of modal adverbs in English and French.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

In this paper we explore the systematicity and frequency of such examples in both French and English based on extensive contextualised corpus-based analysis. In particular, we will focus on their functional and formal features and attest to what extent they can be diagnosed as representative of ongoing intersubjectification processes. In doing so, we will trace differences and similarities between the two languages. The study shows that there is indeed fertile ground for such expressions to develop in the direction of discourse markers and that they evolve at slightly different paces in both languages.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

This may be a directly adjacent contribution, some less directly adjacent contribution, or a conversational contribution uttered in some prior discourse. As for its sequential status, a challenge is a responsive contribution, and from an interpersonal perspective, it tends to carry a high degree of face-threatening potential. A felicitous analysis of a challenge thus needs to go beyond a single conversational contribution, not only accommodating context but also the nature of a challenge’s embeddedness in context. The contribution is organized as follows: The first section systematizes the necessary and sufficient contextual constraints and requirements for a conversational contribution to be assigned the status of a challenge. The second part argues for a challenge to be conceptualized as a particularized contextual configuration, which may serve as a tertium comparationis in contrastive pragmatics. The third section exemplifies the frame of reference with a contrastive analysis of British and German challenges adopted from a corpus of political interviews. In both sets of data, challenges tend to be realized implicitly, and in both sets, challenging the content of a contribution is more frequent than challenging its force or presuppositions. While the British data display a wider variety of challenges, the German data prefer the content-based, implicitly realized challenge.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

In English and Dutch these were probably introduced (or at the very least revived) into the grammar as loans from Latin. To the extent that they have received attention, the linguistics of these three languages traditionally treats them as mere passive alternates of accusative and infinitives, but in English and Dutch, and probably also in Latin, most NCI patterns can instantiate three distinct constructions: a passive NCI, a descriptive NCI and an evidential NCI. Though the latter one especially can be seen to be ‘more grammatical’ than the passive NCI, it is not the result of a grammaticalization change that has taken place inside English or Dutch. In English the evidential NCI did become a productive schematic construction that grew to be very useful in journalistic and academic discourses. In Dutch, on the other hand, the productivity of the NCI constructions has much decreased after a brief 18th-century peak. English and Dutch do have in common, however, that a couple of substantive evidential NCI patterns grammaticalized into deontic NCI constructions, which at present is the most frequent NCI construction in Dutch.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The cleft clause opens up the utterance to heteroglossic negotiation by representing one of its clause elements as a semantic gap. The identity of the semantic gap is then identified by the clefted constituent in the superordinate clause.

In Talmy’s (1991) classification, Chinese and English fall into the same typological category as satellite-framed languages, where large numbers of verbs characteristically incorporate Manner with Motion, and the Path of motion is typically mapped onto a post-verb satellite. Previous contrastive studies of Chinese and English, however, have concluded that Chinese deviates from a typical satellite-framed language as represented by English with respect to both the conflation of Manner with Motion and the representation of the Path of motion. The present study, which examines, specifically, how communication verbs express speaking events in written narrative in Chinese and English, has found more intra-typological differences between the two languages in their representation of meanings in surface structures as well as in the narrative style in which words of a particular category are chosen for representing events. The major original findings from this study are that Chinese is by far more constrained than English in its encoding of semantic components in communication verbs, and that a translator may face a great challenge when doing Chinese-to-English translation with respect to the choice of appropriate communication verbs.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The paper aims at showing that it is worthwhile staking out and exploring such a field. Starting off from a brief reminder of what information structure is, as conceived of by Lambrecht (1994), the paper proposes guiding questions that contrastive information structure analysis should strive to answer. It then turns to the discussion of an example of contrastive analysis which involves the information structural category of identifiability. It is argued that the variable x in the English formula ‘as for x’ and the corresponding German formula was x {(an)betrifft?/?angeht} in sentence initial position can only be instantiated by expressions that have identifiable discourse referents. Results of a corpus-based comparison of expressions which instantiate x in these English and German formulas are presented. These results show contrasts between English and German in the lexicogrammatical expression of identifiable referents that go beyond the better-known differences in the use of the definite article.

10.1075/lic.8.1.02mor;Liesbeth Mortier;An analysis of progressive aspect in French and Dutch in terms of Variation and Specialization;2008;This paper tackles the concepts of ‘Variation’ and ‘Specialization’, frequently used in grammaticalization theory, within the context of progressive aspectual periphrases and from a comparative perspective French-Dutch. Drawing on historical and contemporary data, it is shown that these periphrases (i) have a disambiguating function, (ii) vary as to the level of Specialization operating on them, and (iii) manifest a relatively high level of formal fusion and semantic uniformity, due to processes of ‘metaphorization’, ‘reanalysis’ and ‘desemanticization’. The synergy between ‘Variation’ and ‘Specialization’ as proposed in this analysis allows for a comprehensive account of linguistic phenomena which are subject to (especially incipient) grammaticalization.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.8.1.03sol;K?re Solfjeld;Sentence splitting and discourse structure in translations;2008;The typical informational density in German non-fictional prose often triggers sentence splitting in translations into Norwegian. Information given as VP- or NP-adjunctions in the monosentential source versions is extracted and rendered as independent sentences or conjuncts in coordinative structures in the target version. Typically, subordination in the source version signals that the information should not be seen as the main focus of the sentence. Hence, an important means of guiding the reader with regard to discourse function is lost in the translated version. This article aims at showing how certain choices of target version form can be explained by the goal of preserving the discourse structure of the original. A recurring strategy is the use of coordinated clauses or VPs in the target version. Coordination — at least in narratives licensing consequential readings between the first and second conjunct — is exploited as a device of ’downgrading’ the information of the first conjunct to a background role, preserving the second conjunct as the main focus equivalent to the original. Thus, coordination seems to compensate for the more restricted use of syntactic subordination in Norwegian.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The aim of the present study is to examine how the L1 phrase structure and corresponding L1 word integration skills of ESL learners influence their corresponding ESL sentence processing skills in an on-line English sentence reading task. The study examined the English predicate and verb phrase processing skills of a group of Chinese ESL learners whose language has right-branching L1 verb phrase structures (head-complement word order) and a group of proficiency-matched Korean ESL learners whose native language only allows left-branching L1 verb phrase structures (i.e., complement-head word order). The Chinese ESL group (n?=?20) was significantly faster than the Korean ESL group (n?=?18) in reading and integrating direct object nouns into English predicate phrase structures, though there were no significant differences comprehending the sentences. In addition, the Chinese ESL group was significantly more accurate in reading and comprehending transitive sentences in which the direct objects had an embedded relative clause. The results suggest that L1 word integration skills influence and shape the emergence of on-line ESL word integration;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Nevertheless, recent research has demonstrated that advanced English learners of L2 Spanish attain a native-like morphosyntactic competence for the Preterit/Imperfect contrast, as evidenced by their native-like knowledge of associated semantic entailments (Goodin-Mayeda and Rothman 2007, Montrul and Slabakova 2003, Slabakova and Montrul, 2003, Rothman and Iverson 2007).

I call this hypothesis the Competing Systems Hypothesis. To test its predictions, I compare and contrast the use of the Preterit and Imperfect in two production tasks by native, tutored (classroom), and naturalistic learners of L2 Spanish.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

It is suggested that, in at least some cases, translations can be seen as a kind of mirror reflecting the pragmatic processes at work in lexical interpretation. A translator may choose to render an underspecified concept encoded in a source text by a word that more closely encodes the interpretation given to the concept in question, in which case the semantics/pragmatics distinction (as it applies to the source text) will be made explicit in the relation between source and target text. In other cases, the comparison of source and target text shows that similar lexical encodings in the two languages do not necessarily provide the same possibilities for lexical broadening.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The study aims at testing the validity of Kortmann’s scale of informativeness of semantic / discourse relations (e.g. Condition, Cause, Simultaneity, etc.) as a (partial) account of explicitation by means of sentence and discourse connectives. The methodology is text-based and involves collecting a database of pairs of sequences (English source text, Catalan translation), identifying the most plausible interpretation between free adjunct and matrix clause, and classifying them into instances that have undergone explicitation vs. non-explicitation. The data are analysed quantitatively (by finding the percentages of explicitation per relationship) as well as qualitatively (by analysing the kinds of semantic shifts that occur between source texts and translations).;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Based on a study of professional translations of donc into a number of languages, I then show that it is bound by instructions to a particular ‘function domain’ which is probably used intuitively by translators, and I proceed to discuss how function domains may be circumscribed. Network analysis may be used to this end, and I show the results of a recent experiment involving this method. These results turn out to raise a new series of problems, and I consider the possibility of resolving some of these by a combination of network analysis and Dyvik’s (1998 a and b) ‘semantic mirrors’ analysis.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

(N)so is an additive focus marker. Its use gives the addressee an indication that the (n)so-utterance ought to be processed within a parallel context provided by the immediately preceding utterance. It highlights the fact that the kind of parallel context that licenses the use of (n)so is much more lenient than is the case for the use of its English equivalent also/too. Significantly, an explanatory relation is among the inferential relations that may arise as a result of the use of the clausal coordinating connective na, a situation which is not permissible in the case of its English counterpart and. The contrastive marker nanso, much like its English counterpart but, signals that the proposition expressed in a following utterance is contrary to what is to be expected. It is suggested that specific language-internal facts ought to be recognized and accounted for within the pursuit of a general cognitive theory of utterance interpretation.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The Catalan corpus consists of 93 RDs which have been coded according to three parameters: (1) the point where the entity in the right-dislocated constituent had appeared in the discourse, (2) consequences of eliminating the right-dislocated constituent and (3) consequences of restoring the canonical order. I argue that RD in Catalan is a means to structure information in a coherent way by displacing old information from the main clause. Three main types of RDs can be found: (1) RDs which activate an entity which was no longer accessible in the discourse and make it highly salient, while still marking its discourse-old status; (2) RDs which make explicit an implicit, never textually mentioned, referent and places it in a discourse-old information position. (3) RDs referring to entities mentioned in the previous sentence. Such RDs convey an additional meaning, some ‘emotional content’, having to do with the expression of opposition or emphasis. In order to analyse crosslinguistic differences, an English text and its Catalan translation have been used. The Catalan translation contained 42 instances of RD, while the English text contained none, which shows that the two languages use different strategies to encode information packaging. The Catalan translation uses RDs mostly in cases in which the English original repeats the same phrase in two consecutive utterances and in utterances which convey contrast or opposition.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

A corpus-based research architecture, embedded in an empirical research methodology, will be outlined, and first results and possible explanations will be discussed. The paper starts with a terminological clarification of the concepts of ‘explicitness’ and ‘explicitation’ in terms of dependent variables to be investigated. The two terms — and their usage by other scholars — will be discussed. An electronic corpus will then be described which provides the empirical data and techniques for information extraction. For the investigation carried out using our corpus, indicators will then be derived on the basis of which operationalizations and hypotheses can be formulated for patterns of explicitation occurring between source and target texts. Some initial results relating to cohesive explicitness and explicitation in the data will be presented and discussed, with particular attention being paid to the areas of ‘reference’, ‘substitution‘, ‘ellipsis’, ‘conjunction’, and ‘lexical cohesion’.

10.1075/lic.7.2.10kun;Kerstin Kunz;A method for investigating coreference in translations and originals;2007;Coreference is one essential strategy of coherence and cohesion as it establishes connectivity in texts. This connection is evoked by linguistic devices on the text surface but has to be interpreted mentally as a relation between extralinguistic referents. Since translators are concerned with the reception of connectivity in source texts and the production of the same kind of connectivity in target texts coreference is an important process taking place in translation. The present paper deals with the elaboration of a method for investigating nominal coreference in originals and translations. In order to build parameters for the empirical analysis of coreference in English and German corpora we provide an overview over various mechanisms affecting the creation of coreference relations in source and target texts. We take account of linguistic as well as extralinguistic aspects as interdependent and interacting factors potentially causing shifts in coreference. The model we establish on the basis of these considerations allows us to investigate nominal coreferring expressions as well as analyse the relation of reference identity created between these expressions. Hence, our model facilitates exhaustive research on a very fine-grained scale. It allows us to capture differences on the lexicogrammatical as well as on a semantic and conceptual level and, thus, paves the way for interpretation on a more conceptual level.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

A number of restrictive elements in the two languages involved, English and Spanish, have been selected as search words and their behaviours have been analyzed on the basis of their textual environments. Apart from an overall description of meanings and uses, the article aims at verifying a linguistic hunch: cognates and also word-forms coming from the same lexeme were intuitively considered to differ more than might be expected, which has altogether been proved by the data found. Finally, a series of correspondences are suggested as translational options into Spanish for the most frequent uses and co-occurrences of the English elements.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.7.1.04pit;Mirna Pit;Cross-linguistic analyses of backward causal connectives in Dutch, German and French;2007;The Dutch, German and French languages display a variety of regularly used connectives all of which introduce causes, arguments or reasons, such as Dutch omdat, want and aangezien, German weil, denn and da, and French parce que, car and puisque. Why should these languages have different connectives to express the notion of backward causality? The central argument developed in this article is that the use of these connectives is dependent on the degree of subjectivity associated with the causal relation. The pre-eminence of this account with respect to prior accounts of the uses of these connectives is established on the basis of a series of corpus analyses. The outcomes show that the degree of subjectivity of the main participant involved in the causal relation strongly predicts the occurrence of one or another connective. A distinction can be made between objective connectives like omdat and doordat, parce que and weil on the one hand and subjective connectives like want and aangezien, car and puisque and denn and da on the other hand. No differences between the subjective connectives aangezien/want, puisque/car and denn/da could be observed in terms of subjectivity, but additional frequency data and analyses of translation practices revealed promising directions for supplementary explanations.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

However, used as prefixes, or in particular as preverbs, the similarities between sur- and op- seem to be much weaker. Instead, sur- corresponds more often to over-: e.g. surestimer quelque chose/iets overschatten (“to overestimate something”). From the analysis of a bilingual dictionary, we will investigate this phenomenon. At a morpho-syntactic level, on the one hand, we will show that French and Dutch preverbs appear in different types of constructions. At the semantic level, on the other hand, we will demonstrate that prepositions in preverbal use can develop new, often aspectual, meanings, but that this re-semanticization process does not necessarily follow the same paths in French and Dutch.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The paper also presents an exploratory study analysing theme–rheme structure in these subcorpora. Two definitions of theme were used: Halliday’s ideational theme and preverbal theme (i.e., all clause constituents before the finite verb of the main clause). The study adopted a target-oriented approach and assessed the acceptability of the translated texts with regard to the statistical norm of the comparable native-speaker Spanish subcorpus. Statistically significant differences were found for marked theme and its different syntactic manifestations (prepositional phrase adjunct and subordinate clauses) and there was evidence of a different thematic distribution within the semantic category person (researcher, patient, first person). The most striking results were found for different measures of theme length, suggesting a consistent information overload in the thematic zone in the whole RA and in the individual rhetorical sections except for the Introduction. The translated texts occupy a kind of no-man’s land half-way between the source articles and the independently created Spanish RAs. A refined three-stage model of the study design is proposed for future target-oriented quantitative and qualitative research into translation.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Western companies spend vast sums of money devising brand names that convey the positive characteristics of products marketed on the strength of their image. Many of the brand names patented are complex linguistic units, using aspects of phonology, orthography, morphology, syntax and semantics to make names memorable. These names use language to impact on readers and therefore have transferable meanings. This article analyses the linguistic devices in a corpus of English language adverts and investigates which translation strategies are employed when the adverts are transferred into Russian. It argues that the transfer process is more complex than previous literature has suggested and that although the original meaning is often not maintained after transfer, brand names in the target adverts carry new connotations which are appealing due to the target audience’s expectations.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

10.1075/lic.6.1.06fil;Luna Filipovi?;Weaving the web of meaning;2006;Talmy’s (1985) typology proposes a classification of languages on the basis of their lexicalization patterns. All languages exhibit the tendency to code either manner or path of motion in the verb, and thus are divided accordingly into two main typological groups. The fact that languages code components of a motion event differently is therefore not a novelty, and it is only the point of departure in this paper. The aim here is to account for why these differences in lexicalization may occur. Many, if not all, languages make use of both patterns in expressions of motion events, and the reasons why one is more prominent and favoured than the other and on what occasions is the subject of the present discussion. Extensive data from Serbian/Croatian is presented in a contrastive setting in order to highlight the claim that the typology is best seen as a cline rather than a dichotomy. Two original hypotheses that explain the use of patterns in Serbian/Croatian are put forward, with the possibility to apply them further in analyses of other languages. It will be observed that the mechanism of lexicalization can be explained only after all the levels where meaning is conveyed in a language, namely morphology, syntax and semantics, are subjected to an analysis in a unifying fashion. Moreover, a network of the crucial spatial and temporal parameters is suggested here in order to distinguish event types and determine the language-specific means that reflect those event differences. Particular attention has been paid to a phase in motion events termed moment-of-change, which is notably absent from the relevant discussions in the literature. Another important contribution is the emphasis on the importance of deixis in the lexicalization of motion events, which has not been given the attention it deserves.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Generally speaking, English verbs incorporate manner to their core meaning while Spanish verbs tend to incorporate Path, expressing Manner by means of an additional complement. Comparing English motion events and their translation into Spanish in several novels, Slobin found out that only 51% of English manner verbs were translated into Spanish manner verbs (Slobin 1996), the rest being neutralized or omitted. In this work, we apply Slobin’s analysis to sensory verbs of perception in English and Spanish. Our paper analyzes the conflation patterns of sensory verbs of perception in English and Spanish in order to investigate possible changes in the informational load during the translation process. For this purpose, we have extracted 200 sensory verbs of perception from two English and two Spanish novels and their respective translations. The paper examines instances of gain or loss of information during the translation process, as well as whether the translation shifts provide evidence for a difference in the way the perception event is structured in both languages;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.5.2.04xu;Jie Xu;Possessor raising in Chinese and Korean;2006;"A possessor NP may move out from the Spec position of a containing NP in some Asian languages such as Chinese and Korean, yielding the so-called ‘Possessor Raising Construction’. From the perspective of a syntactic theory based on principles and parameters of Universal Grammar, rather than on differing sets of rules for different particular languages, we in this article argue that the diverse Possessor Raising phenomena can well be subsumed along with ‘Passivization’ and ‘Subject Raising’ under the general syntactic process of ‘NP Movement’. The movement of Possessor Raising is driven by a functional motivation, which is to separate the possessor NP from the possession NP in order to emphasize the former. It has been demonstrated that the operation of Possessor Raising is well under the constraint of UG principles in interaction with independently explainable language-particular properties, in particular, it is mainly determined by the following three factors: (1) Whether the raised possessor NP can be properly Case-marked in its new site; (2) Whether the nominal residue left behind by the NP movement can be Case-marked; and (3) Whether other applicable conditions on movement such as the Subjacency can be satisfied. Most of our arguments are constructed on the basis of the analysis of a whole set of comparable language phenomena from Chinese, Korean and English, and those phenomena, most of which are well observed in the literature, are recast and explained in a very much principled way.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

10.1075/lic.5.1.04beh;Bergljot Behrens;Cohesive ties in translation: A contrastive study of the Norwegian connective dermed;2005;Within a dynamic semantic/pragmatic framework this article discusses the translation relations of the Norwegian connective dermed with respect to English primarily, but also to some extent with respect to German. Data are extracted from the Oslo Multilingual Corpus. Translations between English and Norwegian are analysed in detail with a view to their interpretive resemblance as this concept is used in relevance theory. An event-based analysis is considered a fruitful addition to the relevance theoretic framework for an evaluation of the translation data. Corpus-based frequency counts are then presented to demonstrate the extent to which source language norms influence the use of linking adverbials in translation. The discrepancy between the norms of originally produced Norwegian and the findings in the translation data suggests that the translator is well advised to look for alternative means to trigger the consequential interpretation this connective gives rise to.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

In turn, contrastive analysis is what enables us to represent the conceptual space that forms the basis for semantic mapping. The approach is illustrated with examples of expressions of adversative coherence relations from English and French political discourse.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.5.1.06ste;Erich Steiner;Some properties of texts in terms of ‘information distribution’ across languages;2005;On a global level, an attempt will be made to relate relatively macro-level intuitions about properties of texts to more micro-level notions and to empirically testable lexicogrammatical properties. The strategy will be to (a) partly reduce an intuitive notion of ‘information distribution’ in texts and sentences to more technical and better understood notions of ‘information structure’, ‘informational density’ and ‘grammatical metaphoricity’, and (b) operationalize these latter notions in such a way as to make them empirically testable on electronic corpora, using the ‘shallow’ concepts of ‘explicitness, density, and directness’ as properties of semantics-to-grammar mapping in sentences. It will furthermore be suggested that aspects of intuitive qualities of texts, such as ‘content orientation’ vs. ‘interactant orientation’ and others can be partly modelled in terms of (a) and (b). The argumentation in this paper thus proceeds from intuitive text-level notions to more technical and clause-based concepts, and from these concepts to operationalizations. It then moves ‘upwards’ again to text-level properties, exploring the relationships between the two levels. Finally, an outline is attempted of some implications for studies of language contact and language change.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.5.1.07mau;Anna Mauranen;Contrasting languages and varieties with translational corpora;2005;"Translations are invaluable sources for contrastive research. Yet they possess specific linguistic features, which arise from the nature of translation as a form of language contact. This paper explores some aspects of the specificity of translated texts: social and cognitive determinants of translations are briefly discussed, and the linguistic consequences are evaluated in view of recent findings of corpus research based on translational corpora, parallel as well as monolingual comparable corpora. It is argued that we cannot hope to ‘purify’ translational data so as to have them reflect two fully independent languages, unless we sacrifice the use of naturally-occurring data. Translational corpora are biased for genre, because translation situations are asymmetrical, and they are biased for equivalence, because the situation necessitates a search for equivalence more than might be natural in spontaneous production. However, translation and other language contact are ubiquitous in our globalized world; thus entirely independent, ‘pure’ languages are more illusory than real, thus hardly worth hankering after.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The material demonstrates clearly the greater frequency and versatility of Swedish man and the restricted use of English one. The difference is partly register-related: while man is stylistically neutral one is relatively formal and often replaced by you or various other pronouns. However, the most striking difference is syntactic. The English correspondences of man cut across grammatical systems and can be seen to reflect two diverging tendencies: the English fiction texts often have a subject corresponding to Swedish man, but the non-fiction texts rely to a large extent on syntactic shifts and clause reductions without a corresponding subject. In other words, the difference between the languages is not just a matter of pronoun choice but of syntactic preferences and subject selection.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The paper deals with basic mental verbs in Swedish from this perspective based on data from translation corpora against the background of available information about typological patterns. A brief sketch is given of language-specific characteristics of the nuclear verb se ‘see’ which is the primary equivalent of English see but is also frequently used as an equivalent of look used as an activity verb (look at) and as a phenomenon-based verb (e.g. look happy). The extensive pattern of polysemy of the verb k?nna ‘feel’ is dealt with in detail and turns out to have several language-specific characteristics even in comparison with closely related languages such as German and English. Swedish veta is shown to have a more restricted extension beyond its basic meaning than its primary English equivalent know. English in this case appears to represent a more common pattern than Swedish judging from available typological data. A major section is also devoted to the semantic differentiation between the three basic verbs of thinking t?nka-tro-tycka which represents one of the major language-specific characteristics of Swedish mental verbs.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

10.1075/lic.4.2.03cru;Madalena Cruz-Ferreira;Portuguese and English intonation in contrast;2004;The current surge of interest in studies on intonation, in areas ranging from L2 teaching to child language acquisition, finally mirrors the crucial role played by intonation in the whole of human communication through language. In studies on non-native linguistic proficiency, a ‘foreign intonation’ appears as the last stronghold of a non-native accent, consisting in the use, in a second language, of intonation patterns belonging to the first language of the learner. The use of a foreign intonation does not, however, only characterise an accent. Intonation patterns convey specific meanings in each language, and the correspondence between these meanings and specific pitch patterns is often as arbitrary as the correspondence between words and their meanings. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to provide a basis for the comparison of the intonation patterns of (European) Portuguese and (British) English, highlighting potential areas of difficulty for speakers of each of these languages in learning the other, and the reasons for these difficulties. Second, to give support to the view, current in L2 studies, that the learning of L2 intonation cannot be taken for granted, if breakdown in native to non-native spoken communication is to be avoided.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Due to the striking syntactico-semantic differences observed in these languages, we deem it necessary, in the first place, to distinguish two distinct classes of change of state attributive structures: ‘canonical attributive clauses’, such as In spring the land turns emerald and Las aguas se hab?an vuelto amargas, and ‘resultative attributive clauses’ of the type illustrated in My throat was swelling shut and Se ti?e el pelo de rubio. We then proceed to compare the grammatical behaviour each set of constructions exhibits in English and Spanish, in order to demonstrate that, as regards the syntactic encoding of the semantic notion of becoming, the linguistic phenomenon known as ‘attribution’ is, in short, syntactically, semantically and pragmatically far more constrained in the latter language than in the former: on the one hand, its attributive verbal system is subject to greater and stricter semantico-pragmatic restrictions than its English counterpart; and on the other, the productivity of its resultative pattern is quite marginal in comparison with the English one.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

German structures of the type man sieht, with the generic subject man and a perception verb, are compared with (1) their translations into English and Norwegian, (2) the sources in English and Norwegian texts which give rise to such structures in German translations, and (3) the parallel translations in English and Norwegian where German man is introduced in the translation from the other language. Although similar means are available in the three languages, there are important differences, particularly between German and English. For German and Norwegian the three correspondence relations produce the same overall pattern, for German and English the patterns vary greatly with the type of correspondence relation. The multilingual comparison throws the characteristics of the languages into relief, so that we can see similarities and differences more clearly and in more detail.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Since of course proves to be very frequent in English, learners will need to know what meanings the item has and in what pragmatic contexts it is used. It has indeed been shown that some learners tend to use of course in contexts where it is felt by native speakers to be inappropriate. In order to explain such inappropriate uses we need detailed descriptions of the semantics and pragmatics of of course. From a theoretical point of view such multifunctional items raise the question of whether semantic polysemy or pragmatic polysemy is the best explanatory account. It is argued in this paper that empirical cross-linguistic work can contribute to providing answers to all three research questions. First, the study of correspondences and differences between languages with regard to the meanings and uses of pragmatic markers is a necessary step in the explanation of learner problems. Second, the bidirectional approach to equivalents, which involves going back and forth from sources to translations, enables us to show to what extent the equivalents have partially overlapping pragmatic functions. An in-depth comparison of the semantic fields in which the translation equivalents operate is the ultimate goal. Third, the translation method helps to see to what extent a core meaning account is justified. In this paper three languages are brought into the picture, viz. English, Swedish and Dutch. The cross-linguistic data have been gathered from three translation corpora, i.e. the English-Swedish Parallel Corpus, the Oslo Multilingual Corpus and the Namur Triptic Corpus.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.4.1.04ros;David Rose;The structuring of experience in the grammars of Pitjantjatjara and English;2004;This paper briefly surveys grammatical resources in the Australian language Pitjantjatjara, for representing the experience of its speakers, and contrasts these with corresponding resources in English. The focus is on types of grammatical structure, interpreted from the perspective of discourse semantics, using the analytic tools of systemic functional linguistics (SFL). However the field is built up in steps so that no prior knowledge of (SFL) is expected of the reader. The starting point is with types of structure within clauses, for construing experience as configurations of people, things, processes, places and qualities. An ‘orbital’ model is proposed for interpreting these structures. This is the basis for analysing structures that link clauses in series, including types of interdependency and logical relations between clauses. A ‘serial’ model is proposed for interpreting these types of structure. Finally these resources for structuring experience within and between clauses are contextualised in patterns of discourse, using extended text examples.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The study attempts to achieve two main goals. Firstly, we investigate the usefulness of the transitive/ergative distinction developed by Davidse (1992) for material processes in English, when applied to different process types in both English and Spanish. Secondly, we attempt to provide a fine-grained specification of these linguistic resources which might form the basis for computational treatment in the applied context of Multilingual Generation (MLG), the automatic production of texts in various languages from a single underlying data source.  We first review the specifications provided for English in the computational grammar Nigel (Mann 1983; Matthiessen 1988; Matthiessen and Bateman 1991), and in the extensive reference grammar developed by Matthiessen (1995), showing that, though useful for practical generation purposes, they conflate the notions of agency and causation under the same system. These specifications thus blur the transitive/ergative distinction, which is also fundamental to observe how semantically related verbs may behave differently in English and in Spanish (Lavid and Ar?s 1998a, 1998b; Ar?s and Lavid 2001). We propose, instead, a model of nuclear transitivity consisting of three simultaneous systems: a system of agency (concerned with the presence or absence of the feature Agent), a system of process type (concerned with the semantic type of process involved), and a system of causation (concerned with the variable of instigation). This latter system establishes the paradigmatic distinction between transitive and ergative processes which we claim to be fundamental for an accurate contrastive description of English and Spanish. It is expected that the proposed model, which captures the common semantic potential of nuclear transitivity in English and Spanish, will prove useful as the linguistic basis for a more detailed computational specification in the context of MLG.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

It is argued that some of the traditional criteria used to distinguish between these positions, especially the criterion of pronominal resumption, are not entirely reliable, and a number of new criteria are introduced, including distribution in non-declarative contexts. On the basis of these descriptive refinements, it is proposed that the opposition between intra-clausal and extra-clausal positions can be defined functionally in terms of the scope of illocution markers: the intra-clausal position falls within the scope of illocution, whereas the extra-clausal position is outside its scope. This functional generalization does not only help to explain the various formal criteria that distinguish the two positions, but it is also in line with their typical discourse functions.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.4.1.07ste;Erich Steiner;Ideational grammatical metaphor: Exploring some implications for the overall model;2004;In this paper I want to explore the systemic-functional notion of ‘grammatical metaphor’ from a cross-linguistic perspective. After a brief introduction to the concept of ‘grammatical metaphor’, I shall discuss the distinction between ‘congruent’ and ‘metaphorical’ encodings of meaning, as well as the distinction between rankshift, transcategorization, and grammatical metaphor as semogenic resources (Section 1). In a second section, I shall then focus on ideational grammatical metaphors in English and German and revisit the notion of direct vs. indirect mapping of experiential and logical semantics onto lexicogrammar (Section 2). It will be argued that ‘directness of encoding’ within one language can be defined with the help of the concept of ‘transparency’ or ‘motivation’ of encoding between levels. Across and between languages, however, the notion of ‘directness’ either has to be seen from the perspective of one of the languages involved, or from the perspective of a generalized semantics and grammar. In Section 3, I shall then explore the question of the experiential vs. logical encoding of semantic categories across languages, and of how this relates to metaphoricity. I shall exemplify and discuss the fact that in cross-linguistic analyses, one cannot consider any one of a given set of experiential or logical encodings of some unit of meaning as ‘congruent’ or ‘direct’, as long as one does not have a cross-linguistic semantics to establish ‘motivation’ and ‘transparentness’ on. It will also be argued that some of the differences in texts across languages as to what counts as ‘congruent’ can be predicted from comparisons between the language-specific grammatical systems involved. Other differences, however, seem to rely heavily on registerial influences and cultural factors. In Section 4, then, I shall inquire into the question of whether and precisely in what sense we can speak of two different types of grammatical metaphor, dependent on whether they involve a relocation in rank or a mere re-arrangement of mappings of semantic and lexicogrammatical functions. These types of metaphor, it will be argued, have different implications for the metaphoricity of the clause as a whole, as well as for the ‘density’ of the packaging of meaning.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

These are, for identity, English same and identical and Dutch zelfde and identiek, and, for difference, English other and different and their Dutch counterparts ander, verschillend and verscheiden. Throughout, the contrastive description offered will be based on the analysis of corpus examples of these nine adjectives and on the quantification of their distinct uses. In the first place, I will investigate whether the grammaticalization claim made about English adjectives of comparison in Breban (2002) and Breban and Davidse (forthcoming) also applies to Dutch adjectives of comparison. According to this claim, the English adjectives of identity and difference have two distinct types of uses, fully lexical uses and textual — referential and cohesive — uses which are connected as points of departure and result of a process of grammaticalization. I will show that the same grammaticalization process characterizes the semantics of Dutch adjectives of identity and difference, which hence provides an additional, comparative, argument in support of the grammaticalization hypothesis. Secondly, I will, by elaborating the grammaticalization interpretation descriptively, propose a systematic overview of similarities and differences in the semantics of the English and Dutch adjectives of identity and difference. I will focus first on the different degrees of grammaticalization manifested by the English and Dutch adjectives. I will then investigate in what way the various meaning distinctions resulting from the grammaticalization process are distributed over the adjectives in both languages. This will give us some insight into the overall way in which the core adjectives of identity and difference are organized semantically in English and Dutch.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

In this paper, I propose that the English bare plural expresses nonbounded quantity in a mental space, just as the Finnish bare partitive does. The different formal means used by English and Finnish thus converge in the cognitive unity of the grammatical structuring of the lexical content. The bare plural is not the plural counterpart of the indefinite singular, that is, it does not express the discourse status of its referent, but rather, it belongs to the quantity domain. One of the basic tenets of cognitive grammar is that grammar is motivated. I propose that the nonbounded semantics of the bare plural is based on a formal-semantic analogy with mass nouns. This same motivation operates on bare singulars as well, for they too can be used to create a cognitive image similar to that of mass nouns.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The most striking difference is that present tense inflections in Swedish are frequently translated into past tense inflections in English, especially in narrative texts.

10.1075/lic.3.1.03els;Johan Elsness;A contrastive look at the present perfect/preterite opposition in English and Norwegian;2003;This article deals with the opposition between the present perfect and the preterite in English and Norwegian from a contrastive point of view. The use of these verb forms is very similar in the two languages, and markedly different from that in closely related languages such as German and French, where the present perfect is used much more widely. In English and Norwegian the preterite is the norm if the reference is identified as being to past time which is clearly separate from the deictic zero-point, for instance through adverbial specification, while the present perfect is used of situations extending from the past all the way up to the deictic zero-point, and of situations located within such a time span. In many intermediate cases, where the reference is to a loosely defined past time, either verb form may be used in both languages, although several writers have claimed that the present perfect is more common in Norwegian than in English in such cases. The difference between the two languages is more distinct if the reference is to what can be seen as unique past time, in which case the present perfect is usually blocked in English but very common in Norwegian. Also, the so-called inferential perfect in Norwegian is not matched by any similar perfect use in English. These claims are amply confirmed by an investigation of the English–Norwegian Parallel Corpus (ENPC), where the present perfect is more frequent in the Norwegian as compared with the English sections, at the expense of the preterite. Moreover, there is found to be a marked difference between the original and the translated texts of the ENPC: the ratio between the present perfect and the preterite is generally higher in Norwegian than in English but not quite so high in Norwegian texts translated from English as in Norwegian original texts, and somewhat higher in English texts translated from Norwegian than in English original texts. This difference is ascribed to interference from the source language in the translated texts.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.3.1.04fre;Thorstein Fretheim;A relevance-theoretic account of the way we use and understand the English temporal adverb again and its Norwegian counterpart igjen;2003;The English temporal adverb again and the corresponding adverb igjen in Norwegian are words which do not encode a concept but rather an instruction to the audience to let the inferential phase of their comprehension process be guided by a specific contextual assumption. These adverbs have a procedural semantics in the sense of Relevance Theory, which distinguishes them semantically from an expression like once more or the prefix re-, both of which encode a conceptual meaning. English has a single lexical entry again whose encoded meaning is temporal yet not truth-conditional, and there is an exact correspondent igjen in the Norwegian lexicon, though Norwegian igjen in addition appears as two distinct non-temporal words encoding a concept and as a verbal particle forming a lexical entry together with a preceding verb. The full use range of the form igjen is found to be very similar to that of the Latin(ate) prefix re- as well as to the complex meaning of the verbal prefix ga- in the Niger-Congo language Ewe.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

10.1075/lic.2.2.03mau;Anna Mauranen;Will 'translationese' ruin a contrastive study?;2002;Translated texts have been known as source material for contrastive analyses for a long time. Their value as suitable data has tended to be controversial throughout, and a new controversy is springing up now that corpus linguistics offers new perspectives for contrastive studies as well. Now that we can access large databases in any language, is there much point in drawing on the traditional kind of data that translations offer? This paper argues that corpora of translated texts constitute a valuable source of evidence for contrastive research, since they fulfil many of the criteria that have generally been seen as strengths in corpus study — for example language that has been used in its normal communicative contexts by a large number of users. Translations should be recognised as the normal part of a natural language that they are. The paper goes on to investigate a lexical item — English think — and its translation equivalents in Finnish, showing how sense categories of even frequent items can be drawn up with the help of another language. Unsuspected semantic prosodies may also come up in this process, and connections of particular senses with specific meanings. It demonstrates that a parallel corpus can capture relations of sense as well as form, which would be very hard to capture without such data.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.2.2.04tei;Elke Teich;System-oriented and text-oriented comparative linguistic research: Cross-linguistic variation in translation;2002;The main concern of this paper is to develop a model of cross-linguistic variation that is applicable to various kinds of comparative linguistic research. The motivation for this lies in the observation that there is little interaction among the major areas of comparative linguistic investigation — language typology, contrastive linguistics, translation studies, and the computational modeling of multilingual processes as implemented in machine translation or multilingual text generation. The divide between them can be characterized by a general orientation towards describing the relation between language systems (as in language typology) vs. describing the relation between texts (as in translation studies). It will be suggested that with a model of cross-linguistic comparison that accommodates both the system view and the text view on cross-linguistic variation, language typology, contrastive linguistics, translation studies and multilingual computational linguistics can be shown to have mutually compatible concerns rather than being entirely disjunct endeavors. The model proposed is based on Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), using the representational categories SFL sets up as parameters along which cross-linguistic variation can be described. The fundamental assumption brought forward by SFL that acts as a unifier of concerns is that texts are ultimately instantiations of the language system under certain specifiable contexts of use. A model of cross-linguistic variation based on SFL thus bears the promise of opening up the text view for the system-oriented branch of cross-linguistic study, and the system view for the text-oriented branch. I illustrate the model with data from several European languages, concentrating on the register of instructional text.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

We will show that while English and Chinese both mark aspect grammatically, the aspect system in the two languages differs considerably. Even though Chinese, as an aspect language, is rich in aspect markers, covert marking (LVM) is a frequent and important strategy in Chinese discourse. The distribution of aspect markers varies significantly across domain and text type. The study also sheds new light on the translation effect by contrasting aspect marking in translated Chinese texts and L1 Chinese texts.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

The texts in these brochures tend to be instances of 'through-argumentation', where a claim is made — this is the 'thesis cited' — and is then argued through, or 'substantiated'. In the corporate brochure this claim serves to evaluate the company in a highly positive manner. Although these features are common to all of the French and English brochures, there are identifiable differences in the text formats adopted: whereas the English writers tend always to cite the thesis in text-initial position, a significant proportion of the French writers prefer to delay thesis citation. This may be explained, at least partly, in terms of the writer-reader relationship and factors of linguistic politeness. It will be shown that the principles of Politeness Theory, hitherto applied almost exclusively in the study of spoken language, can be used to help analyse and explain certain features of written genres — including those at the level of text structure.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

A description is given of the search techniques employed to locate instances of variation. We present our findings by first describing the variation types common to both languages and thereafter examining cases where variation seemed to be wholly or predominantly language specific. Many similarities were found to exist between the two languages, and language specific variation could often be related to more general language specific features. We also comment on the overall frequency of idiom variation, which was found to be very similar in the two studies. In our concluding remarks we suggest that contrastive idiom analysis of the sort carried out, could and should be undertaken between other language pairs, and that the resulting interlingual descriptions would be of use in practical applications such as second language learning and computational tasks.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

Corpora of translated English-German texts reveal that only about a third of English it-clefts (or less, depending on text type) are translated with the German equivalent, a Spaltsatz. This may in part be due to differences in the restrictions the two languages place on the focused XP with regard to both grammatical function and category. Against this background we look at the different structures that German uses to render the English it-cleft. It is notable that even where the German Spaltsatz is a grammatically possible translation, other structures are frequently employed instead. This shows that factors such as the discoursefunction (s) of cleft sentences also play a decisive role in selecting stylistically well-formed translations. After a thorough study and analysis of a small sample of translated it-clefts (English-German) in their contexts, we propose the following hypothesis: The main discourse function of English it-clefts — the focusing of an XP element — may not only be translated into German with a Spaltsatz, but can also be presented adequately by introducing specific word orders, focusing particles, or both. In this way, the often cumbersome German cleft construction is dropped in favor of mono clausal sentences.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

10.1075/lic.2.1.05mau;Anna Mauranen;What Sort of Theme is there?: A translational perspective;2000;Non-referential there has been widely discussed as part of existential sentences, and as an organiser of information in the sentence. Much less attention has been paid to its roles in discourse. As an item without a direct equivalent in many languages, it offers an interesting issue for contrastive analysis: how are its various roles handled in translation? This paper explores uses of thematic there on the basis of a parallel corpus with two-way translations between English and Finnish, focusing on two questions: how translators deal with the information structure of there constructions, and what discourse functions thematic non-referential there is used for. Overall, translators tended to maintain the original information structure, particularly its main focus, without translating word by word, and showing sensitivity to the text level. Pre-topical orienting themes played an adaptive role in focus maintenance. In discourse, there constructions play an important role in organising information: they prospect and introduce new items, new points, topics, and conclusions. In contrast, Finnish appears to use more orienting themes, new topical themes and verb-initial clauses signalling a change of tack in discourse. The findings throw into sharp relief sentences without topic or theme, and question the universality of both phenomena.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

10.1075/lic.2.1.08ton;Ingebj?rg Tonne;A Norwegian Progressive Marker and the Level of Grammaticalization;2000;"In this paper it is shown that parallel concordancing represents an efficient means of explicating the grammaticalization level of linguistic forms. One progressive form in Norwegian and the progressive in Spanish are found to be translationally equivalent in some contexts but not in others. In addition, the degree of overlap of the two constructions is seen to vary with the direction of the translation, i.e. the Norwegian progressive is more often translated by a Spanish progressive than vice versa. These results correspond neatly to the part of grammaticalization theory which emphasizes the relation between the general meaning of a form, the widening of distribution and the increase in frequency.; The general meaning of the Spanish progressive gives it a wider distribution and a higher frequency than the Norwegian progressive. Corresponding results are also found in a test case comparing the Norwegian and the English progressives. Parallel concordancing thus strengthens the claim based on monolingual studies that this Norwegian progressive is partially but not totally grammaticalized. The parallel concordancing method has the additional advantage that the contexts determining when the forms are translationally equivalent can be read off directly from the concordances.";LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

First I take stock of the different verb classes associated with one or both variants in Dutch and English. Whereas both the spray and the load-classes alternate in English, only the spray-verbs do so in Dutch. However, the alternating spray-class is much more extended in Dutch, which I then argue is partly due to the use of the prefix be- in Dutch in one of the variants. Be-, I show, has an applicative meaning, and is used to bring out the correspondence between Patients designating a surface and the locative Process. When they are not prefixed by ht-, these verbs have a primarily dispersive meaning, which tends to collocate with the Patient designating the substance.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

We will try to show that the causee — a hybrid semantic role as it is both a patient and an agent — has special relationships with object case marking. The evidence shows that Germanic languages such as German and English, and some Romance languages such as Spanish and Portuguese, resort to positional rules to preserve the distinction between causee and true object. Other Romance languages such as Italian and French, however, obtain the same result by morphological means, especially as regards the causee. We claim that such differences can be better understood in the light of a diachronic and typological study of causative constructions in these languages.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
10.1075/lic.1.2.05sie;Anna Siewierska;Languages With and Without Objects: The Functional Grammar Approach;1999;Among the theoretical frameworks which consider grammatical relations to be a possible but not necessary level of clausal organization, the approach to the object relation espoused in Simon Dik's (1978, 198g, 1997) Functional Grammar is the most restrictive. Unlike various other models of grammar, only one object relation is recognized and its presence in a language is conditional on the existence of a productive dative-shift opposition relating predications depicting the same states of affairs, as in the case of the English The teacher gave the picture to the child and The teacher gave the child a picture. Taking the existence of pairs of clauses such as these as a diagnostic of the object relation heavily reduces the number of languages manifesting an object relation, so the presence of an object relation emerges as a potentially interesting typological parameter. But do the languages manifesting an object relation, in this restrictive sense of the term, have any properties in common other than the object relation? Little attention has been given to this issue either by Functional Grammarians or other linguists who adopt a similar view of the object relation. The present paper seeks to redress this situation by exploring the cross-linguistic applicability of the object relation, as defined in FG, in an extensive sample of genetically and geographically stratified languages. It examines the typological characteristics of the languages with objects in the FG sense of the term and establishes the typological profile most likely leading to the presence of an object relation.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

It attempts to provide a grammatico-semantic explanation for the extension of agentive to non-agentive -er, and argues that the profile of the -er suffix, irrespective of whether it is agentive or non-agentive, is comparable to that of the subject-Junction of a clausal structure. More particularly, some clausal structures are discussed which show a high number of structural and semantic correspondences with non-agentive -er nominals. Whereas in English, the most important clausal agnate turns out to be the middle construction (e.g. this book reads easily), Dutch non-agentive -er nominals are shown to agnate with various structures, notably middle formation: especially the occurrence of intransitive or 'circumstantial' middles (e.g. asfalt fietst prettiger dan grind 'asphalt cycles better than gravel'), and the frequent use of 'let'-constructions in contexts where English would use a middle (e.g. dat boek laat zich makkelijk lezen [that book lets itself easily read], i.e. that book reads easily) offer evidence of the Dutch potential to construe non-agentive entities as subjects.

10.1075/lic.1.2.08mar;Montserrat Martinez-Vazquez;Effected Objects in English and Spanish;1999;This paper examines resulting objects in English and Spanish. Fillmore's (1968) concept of effected object, e.g. He built the table has been extended to include certain resulting objects which are not sub categorized by their verbs: He kicked a hole in the door, She smiled her thanks or They pushed their way through the crowd. These constructions, we argue, are formed by fusing two semantic predicates into one: the object expresses a result while the verb designates the means by which the intended result is achieved. An analysis of corpus examples demonstrates that they are neither totally lexicalized nor regular productive patterns. The intermediate lexicalized position in question is due to a gradual metaphoric process found in this English construction, a process not allowed in Spanish. The paper concludes that the inability of Spanish to fuse two semantic predicates in this lexically unfilled resulting construction, which works independently of the particular lexical items that instantiate it, may be a consequence of the rigidity of its lexical items, which are strongly marked by morphology. The lack of inflectional information of most English words, on the contrary, confers more grammatical power to the construction.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

While fully acknowledging the usefulness of monolingual concordancing, it aims to show that the strategic use of parallel concordancing can provide new and valuable insights into certain thorny issues. The example chosen is the interaction between French personal pronouns and the animate/inanimate distinction, with particular reference to the use of stressed pronouns. After a brief overview of this issue and its treatment in a number of current grammars, the paper describes various ways of exploiting the bilingual nature of parallel corpora/ concordancer s and discusses the results of different types of search. The evidence shows that stressed pronouns can have inanimate antecedents, but that this is relatively rare and mostly confined to one specific function. Parallel concordancers of the kind used in the study thus provide useful opportunities to approach problems laterally.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST

We examine the role of discourse perspective, as realised by rhetorical relations such as those employed within the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), in further narrowing down the range of choices. We demonstrate that the three languages of study tolerate different levels of ambiguity, and prefer different forms of disambiguation and pragmatic signalling, attesting to the value of empirical methods for contrastive discourse study.

The subjects of the study were 120 advanced Syrian learners of English. The comprehension of 80 English idioms was tested by a multiple-choice test and an English-into-Syrian Arabic translation test. The same idioms were also tested for production by a Syrian Arabic-into-English translation test. Results showed that learners scored higher in the comprehension and production test of cognate idioms because of positive language transfer. Language transfer had a negative effect when processing English idioms which have false cognate equivalents in Syrian Arabic. However, with English idioms that have pragmatic equivalents and those which have no Syrian equivalents at all, the factor of transfer is replaced, as a strategy, by metaphoric association and pragmatic knowledge of the world. The study concludes that the degree of similarity to a native language idiom does not necessarily help in the process of idiom comprehension or production. Meanwhile, the linguistic differences between the English idiom and the Syrian idiom do not automatically lead to problems in comprehending L2 idioms.;LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
